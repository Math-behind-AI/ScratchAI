INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE

Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the 
   human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us 
   who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have 
   made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led 
   to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical 
   suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The 
   continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will 
   certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater 
   damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social 
   disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical 
   suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it 
   survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological 
   suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of 
   adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many 
   other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social 
   machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be 
   inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to 
   prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But 
   the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown 
   will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than 
   later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This 
   revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be 
   a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of 
   that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who 
   hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for 
   a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL 
   revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic 
   and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments 
   that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such 
   developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean 
   that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons 
   we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient 
   public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since 
   there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have 
   written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of 
   wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM

6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of 
   the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, 
   so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to 
   the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.

7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could 
   have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is 
   fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we 
   speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, 
   collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability 
   activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is 
   associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to 
   get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as 
   a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we 
   mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of 
   leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)

8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we 
   would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are 
   trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two 
   psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern 
   leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist 
   psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We 
   leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be 
   applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call 
   “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of inferiority 
   are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is 
   characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment 
   is highly influential.

FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY

10. By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the 
    strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, 
    feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- 
    hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings 
    (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in 
    determining the direction of modern leftism.

11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him 
    (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has 
    inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among 
    minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups 
    whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to 
    designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. 
    The terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped” or “chick” for an African, an 
    Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory 
    connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of 
    “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The negative connotations have been attached to 
    these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have 
    gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by 
    “animal companion.” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid 
    saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be 
    interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by 
    “nonliterate.” They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest 
    that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply 
    that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the 
    hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)

12. Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are 
    not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or 
    disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even 
    belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. 
    Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who 
    have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom 
    are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.

13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups 
    that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), 
    repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel 
    that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that 
    they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these 
    groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean 
    to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making 
    a point about leftist psychology.)

14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as 
    capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as 
    strong and as capable as men.

15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and 
    successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate 
    white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for 
    hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. 
    They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, 
    ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist 
    countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or 
    at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY 
    points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in 
    Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the 
    leftist’s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and 
    the West because they are strong and successful.

16. Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” 
    “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. 
    The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to 
    solve everyone’s problems for them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take 
    care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of 
    confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own 
    needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, 
    deep inside, he feels like a loser.

17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on 
    sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, 
    throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing 
    anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse 
    oneself in the sensations of the moment.

18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective 
    reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true 
    that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific 
    knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be 
    defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply 
    cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. 
    They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. 
    They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one 
    thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it 
    is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the 
    leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs 
    as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., 
    failed, inferior). The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he 
    cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior 
    and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by 
    many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ 
    tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities 
    or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear 
    superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit 
    or blame for an individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is 
    “inferior” it is not his fault, but society’s, because he has not been 
    brought up properly.

19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of 
    inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, 
    a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in 
    himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can 
    still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his 
    efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But the 
    leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so 
    ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and 
    valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as 
    a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies 
    himself.

20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by 
    lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or 
    racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many 
    leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER 
    masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.

21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by 
    moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of 
    the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the 
    main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of 
    leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior 
    is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the 
    leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that 
    affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand 
    affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more 
    productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at 
    least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that 
    affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not 
    take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. 
    Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as 
    an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for 
    power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ 
    hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.

22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to 
    INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making 
    a fuss.

23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate 
    description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only 
    a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.

OVERSOCIALIZATION

24. Psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the process by which 
    children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said 
    to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his 
    society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem 
    senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is 
    perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many 
    leftists are not such rebels as they seem.

25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel 
    and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate 
    anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he 
    admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the 
    attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In 
    order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive 
    themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings 
    and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term 
    “oversocialized” to describe such people. [2]

26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, 
    defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society 
    socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech 
    that is contrary to society’s expectations. If this is overdone, or if 
    a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by 
    feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the 
    oversocialized person are more restricted by society’s expectations than are 
    those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in 
    a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty 
    thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, 
    they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of 
    the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he 
    does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The 
    oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or 
    feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think 
    “unclean” thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we 
    are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under 
    the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on 
    a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has 
    laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of 
    constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that 
    oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings 
    inflict on one another.

27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is 
    oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in 
    determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized 
    type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice 
    that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized 
    segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.

28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological 
    leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong 
    enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally 
    speaking, the goals of today’s leftists are NOT in conflict with the 
    accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral 
    principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of 
    violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, 
    helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom 
    of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the 
    individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the 
    individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at 
    least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These values are 
    explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material 
    presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational 
    system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do 
    not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by 
    claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these 
    principles.

29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows 
    his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while 
    pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative 
    action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved 
    education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life 
    of the black “underclass” they regard as a social disgrace. They want to 
    integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, 
    a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The 
    leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man 
    into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African 
    American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American 
    culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating 
    black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style 
    clothing and going to a black- style church or mosque. In other words, it 
    can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects 
    most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform 
    to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical 
    subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the 
    status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to 
    make black fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become 
    nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the 
    industrial-technological system. The system couldn’t care less what kind of 
    music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he 
    believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs 
    the status ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In 
    effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to 
    integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.

30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, 
    NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they 
    sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel 
    against one of modern society’s most important principles by engaging in 
    physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of 
    “liberation.” In other words, by committing violence they break through the 
    psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are 
    oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for 
    others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify 
    their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence 
    they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.

31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail 
    sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything 
    like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the 
    necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly 
    the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.

32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as 
    a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not 
    restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, 
    they are widespread in our society. And today’s society tries to socialize 
    us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by 
    experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids 
    and so forth.

THE POWER PROCESS

33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we 
    will call the “power process.” This is closely related to the need for power 
    (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power 
    process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, 
    effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose 
    attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some 
    of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be 
    necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later 
    (paragraphs 42-44).

34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just 
    by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious 
    psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he 
    will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become 
    clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to 
    become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to 
    struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that 
    have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and 
    demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not 
    enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.

35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of 
    life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by 
    the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without 
    effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.

36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical 
    necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible 
    with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in 
    defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.

37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs 
    goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate 
    of success in attaining his goals.

SURROGATE ACTIVITIES

38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. For 
    example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, 
    devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. 
    When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs 
    they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then 
    pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they 
    otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. Thus the 
    aristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary pretensions; many 
    European aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy 
    in hunting, though they certainly didn’t need the meat; other aristocracies 
    have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few 
    aristocrats, like Hirohito, have turned to science.

39. We use the term “surrogate activity” to designate an activity that is 
    directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely 
    in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the 
    sake of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is 
    a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given 
    a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask 
    yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying 
    his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical 
    and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel 
    seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, 
    then the person’s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito’s 
    studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it 
    is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at 
    interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, 
    he would not have felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy 
    and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and 
    love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if 
    their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they 
    passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the 
    opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one 
    really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)

40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy 
    one’s physical needs. It is enough to go through a training program to 
    acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the 
    very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are 
    a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one 
    has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an 
    underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are 
    speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it is not surprising that modern 
    society is full of surrogate activities. These include scientific work, 
    athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, 
    climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far 
    beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical 
    satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not 
    important for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who 
    work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always PURE 
    surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by 
    needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may 
    be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to 
    express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. But for most people 
    who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. 
    For example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the 
    “fulfillment” they get from their work is more important than the money and 
    prestige they earn.

41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than 
    the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain 
    even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One 
    indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are 
    deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. 
    Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The 
    scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The 
    long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. Many 
    people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more 
    fulfillment from these activities than they do from the “mundane” business 
    of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the 
    effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to 
    triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their 
    biological needs AUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an immense 
    social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy 
    in pursuing their surrogate activities.

AUTONOMY

42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every 
    individual. But most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in 
    working toward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken on their own 
    initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most 
    people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single 
    individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group. Thus 
    if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful 
    joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be 
    served. But if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that 
    leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need 
    for the power process will not be served. The same is true when decisions 
    are made on a collective basis if the group making the collective decision 
    is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. [5]

43. It is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. 
    Either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying 
    themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. And then 
    there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely 
    physical sense of power (the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of 
    power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind 
    obedience to his superiors).

44. But for most people it is through the power process—having a goal, making an 
    AUTONOMOUS effort and attaining the goal—that self-esteem, self-confidence 
    and a sense of power are acquired. When one does not have adequate 
    opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending 
    on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, 
    demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, 
    depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, 
    insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating 
    disorders, etc. [6]

SOURCES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS

45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern 
    industrial society they are present on a massive scale. We aren’t the first 
    to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing 
    is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that 
    primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better 
    satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all 
    was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common 
    among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some 
    of the American Indian tribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING 
    the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were 
    far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.

46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the 
    fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically 
    different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in 
    ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race 
    developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what 
    we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly 
    experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal 
    conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only 
    one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of 
    social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.

47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are 
    excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive 
    rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale 
    communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.

48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree 
    of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are 
    consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies were 
    predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of 
    cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern 
    agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to support a far 
    denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the 
    effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people’s 
    hands. For example, a variety of noise- making devices: power mowers, 
    radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, 
    people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is 
    restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. 
    But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no 
    conflict and no frustration generated by them.)

49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only 
    slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. In 
    the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the 
    other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to 
    technological change. Thus there is no stable framework.

50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional 
    values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and 
    economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can’t make 
    rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society 
    without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, 
    and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.

51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of 
    the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. The 
    disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact 
    that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new 
    locations, separating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, 
    a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if 
    it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual’s loyalty 
    must be first to the system and only secondarily to a small-scale community, 
    because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger 
    than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own 
    advantage at the expense of the system.

52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his 
    cousin, his friend or his co- religionist to a position rather than 
    appointing the person best qualified for the job. He has permitted personal 
    loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is “nepotism” or 
    “discrimination,” both of which are terrible sins in modern society. 
    Would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating 
    personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very 
    inefficient. (Look at Latin America.) Thus an advanced industrial society 
    can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are emasculated, tamed 
    and made into tools of the system. [7]

53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely 
    recognized as sources of social problems. But we do not believe they are 
    enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today.

54. A few pre-industrial cities were very large and crowded, yet their 
    inhabitants do not seem to have suffered from psychological problems to the 
    same extent as modern man. In America today there still are uncrowded rural 
    areas, and we find there the same problems as in urban areas, though the 
    problems tend to be less acute in the rural areas. Thus crowding does not 
    seem to be the decisive factor.

55. On the growing edge of the American frontier during the 19th century, the 
    mobility of the population probably broke down extended families and 
    small-scale social groups to at least the same extent as these are broken 
    down today. In fact, many nuclear families lived by choice in such 
    isolation, having no neighbors within several miles, that they belonged to 
    no community at all, yet they do not seem to have developed problems as 
    a result.

56. Furthermore, change in American frontier society was very rapid and deep. 
    A man might be born and raised in a log cabin, outside the reach of law and 
    order and fed largely on wild meat; and by the time he arrived at old age he 
    might be working at a regular job and living in an ordered community with 
    effective law enforcement. This was a deeper change than that which 
    typically occurs in the life of a modern individual, yet it does not seem to 
    have led to psychological problems. In fact, 19th century American society 
    had an optimistic and self-confident tone, quite unlike that of today’s 
    society. [8]

57. The difference, we argue, is that modern man has the sense (largely 
    justified) that change is IMPOSED on him, whereas the 19th century 
    frontiersman had the sense (also largely justified) that he created change 
    himself, by his own choice. Thus a pioneer settled on a piece of land of his 
    own choosing and made it into a farm through his own effort. In those days 
    an entire county might have only a couple of hundred inhabitants and was 
    a far more isolated and autonomous entity than a modern county is. Hence the 
    pioneer farmer participated as a member of a relatively small group in the 
    creation of a new, ordered community. One may well question whether the 
    creation of this community was an improvement, but at any rate it satisfied 
    the pioneer’s need for the power process.

58. It would be possible to give other examples of societies in which there has 
    been rapid change and/or lack of close community ties without the kind of 
    massive behavioral aberration that is seen in today’s industrial society. We 
    contend that the most important cause of social and psychological problems 
    in modern society is the fact that people have insufficient opportunity to 
    go through the power process in a normal way. We don’t mean to say that 
    modern society is the only one in which the power process has been 
    disrupted. Probably most if not all civilized societies have interfered with 
    the power process to a greater or lesser extent. But in modern industrial 
    society the problem has become particularly acute. Leftism, at least in its 
    recent (mid- to late-20th century) form, is in part a symptom of deprivation 
    with respect to the power process.

DISRUPTION OF THE POWER PROCESS IN MODERN SOCIETY

59. We divide human drives into three groups: (1) those drives that can be 
    satisfied with minimal effort; (2) those that can be satisfied but only at 
    the cost of serious effort; (3) those that cannot be adequately satisfied no 
    matter how much effort one makes. The power process is the process of 
    satisfying the drives of the second group. The more drives there are in the 
    third group, the more there is frustration, anger, eventually defeatism, 
    depression, etc.

60. In modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the 
    first and third groups, and the second group tends to consist increasingly 
    of artificially created drives.

61. In primitive societies, physical necessities generally fall into group 2: 
    They can be obtained, but only at the cost of serious effort. But modern 
    society tends to guaranty the physical necessities to everyone [9] in 
    exchange for only minimal effort, hence physical needs are pushed into group 
    1. (There may be disagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job 
    is “minimal”; but usually, in lower- to middle- level jobs, whatever effort 
    is required is merely that of OBEDIENCE. You sit or stand where you are told 
    to sit or stand and do what you are told to do in the way you are told to do 
    it. Seldom do you have to exert yourself seriously, and in any case you have 
    hardly any autonomy in work, so that the need for the power process is not 
    well served.)

62. Social needs, such as sex, love and status, often remain in group 2 in 
    modern society, depending on the situation of the individual. [10] But, 
    except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status, the 
    effort required to fulfill the social drives is insufficient to satisfy 
    adequately the need for the power process.

63. So certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group 2, hence 
    serve the need for the power process. Advertising and marketing techniques 
    have been developed that make many people feel they need things that their 
    grandparents never desired or even dreamed of. It requires serious effort to 
    earn enough money to satisfy these artificial needs, hence they fall into 
    group 2. (But see paragraphs 80-82.) Modern man must satisfy his need for 
    the power process largely through pursuit of the artificial needs created by 
    the advertising and marketing industry [11], and through surrogate 
    activities.

64. It seems that for many people, maybe the majority, these artificial forms of 
    the power process are insufficient. A theme that appears repeatedly in the 
    writings of the social critics of the second half of the 20th century is the 
    sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society. (This 
    purposelessness is often called by other names such as “anomic” or 
    “middle-class vacuity.”) We suggest that the so-called “identity crisis” is 
    actually a search for a sense of purpose, often for commitment to a suitable 
    surrogate activity. It may be that existentialism is in large part 
    a response to the purposelessness of modern life. [12] Very widespread in 
    modern society is the search for “fulfillment.” But we think that for the 
    majority of people an activity whose main goal is fulfillment (that is, 
    a surrogate activity) does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment. In 
    other words, it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process. (See 
    paragraph 41.) That need can be fully satisfied only through activities that 
    have some external goal, such as physical necessities, sex, love, status, 
    revenge, etc.

65. Moreover, where goals are pursued through earning money, climbing the status 
    ladder or functioning as part of the system in some other way, most people 
    are not in a position to pursue their goals AUTONOMOUSLY. Most workers are 
    someone else’s employee and, as we pointed out in paragraph 61, must spend 
    their days doing what they are told to do in the way they are told to do it. 
    Even people who are in business for themselves have only limited autonomy. 
    It is a chronic complaint of small-business persons and entrepreneurs that 
    their hands are tied by excessive government regulation. Some of these 
    regulations are doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part government 
    regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our extremely complex 
    society. A large portion of small business today operates on the franchise 
    system. It was reported in the Wall Street Journal a few years ago that many 
    of the franchise-granting companies require applicants for franchises to 
    take a personality test that is designed to EXCLUDE those who have 
    creativity and initiative, because such persons are not sufficiently docile 
    to go along obediently with the franchise system. This excludes from small 
    business many of the people who most need autonomy.

66. Today people live more by virtue of what the system does FOR them or TO them 
    than by virtue of what they do for themselves. And what they do for 
    themselves is done more and more along channels laid down by the system. 
    Opportunities tend to be those that the system provides, the opportunities 
    must be exploited in accord with rules and regulations [13], and techniques 
    prescribed by experts must be followed if there is to be a chance of 
    success.

67. Thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of 
    real goals and a deficiency of autonomy in the pursuit of goals. But it is 
    also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group 3: the 
    drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one 
    makes. One of these drives is the need for security. Our lives depend on 
    decisions made by other people; we have no control over these decisions and 
    usually we do not even know the people who make them. (“We live in a world 
    in which relatively few people—maybe 500 or 1,000—make the important 
    decisions”—Philip B. Heymann of Harvard Law School, quoted by Anthony Lewis, 
    New York Times, April 21, 1995.) Our lives depend on whether safety 
    standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained; on how much 
    pesticide is allowed to get into our food or how much pollution into our 
    air; on how skillful (or incompetent) our doctor is; whether we lose or get 
    a job may depend on decisions made by government economists or corporation 
    executives; and so forth. Most individuals are not in a position to secure 
    themselves against these threats to more [than] a very limited extent. The 
    individual’s search for security is therefore frustrated, which leads to 
    a sense of powerlessness.

68. It may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern 
    man, as is shown by his shorter life expectancy; hence modern man suffers 
    from less, not more than the amount of insecurity that is normal for human 
    beings. But psychological security does not closely correspond with physical 
    security. What makes us FEEL secure is not so much objective security as 
    a sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves. Primitive 
    man, threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger, can fight in self-defense 
    or travel in search of food. He has no certainty of success in these 
    efforts, but he is by no means helpless against the things that threaten 
    him. The modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things 
    against which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food, 
    environmental pollution, war, increasing taxes, invasion of his privacy by 
    large organizations, nationwide social or economic phenomena that may 
    disrupt his way of life.

69. It is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that 
    threaten him; disease for example. But he can accept the risk of disease 
    stoically. It is part of the nature of things, it is no one’s fault, unless 
    it is the fault of some imaginary, impersonal demon. But threats to the 
    modern individual tend to be MAN-MADE. They are not the results of chance 
    but are IMPOSED on him by other persons whose decisions he, as an 
    individual, is unable to influence. Consequently he feels frustrated, 
    humiliated and angry.

70. Thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands 
    (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) whereas the 
    security of modern man is in the hands of persons or organizations that are 
    too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them. So 
    modern man’s drive for security tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some 
    areas (food, shelter etc.) his security is assured at the cost of only 
    trivial effort, whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security. (The 
    foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in 
    a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of 
    primitive man.)

71. People have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessarily 
    frustrated in modern life, hence fall into group 3. One may become angry, 
    but modern society cannot permit fighting. In many situations it does not 
    even permit verbal aggression. When going somewhere one may be in a hurry, 
    or one may be in a mood to travel slowly, but one generally has no choice 
    but to move with the flow of traffic and obey the traffic signals. One may 
    want to do one’s work in a different way, but usually one can work only 
    according to the rules laid down by one’s employer. In many other ways as 
    well, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations 
    (explicit or implicit) that frustrate many of his impulses and thus 
    interfere with the power process. Most of these regulations cannot be 
    dispensed with, because they are necessary for the functioning of industrial 
    society.

72. Modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive. In matters that 
    are irrelevant to the functioning of the system we can generally do what we 
    please. We can believe in any religion we like (as long as it does not 
    encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system). We can go to bed with 
    anyone we like (as long as we practice “safe sex”). We can do anything we 
    like as long as it is UNIMPORTANT. But in all IMPORTANT matters the system 
    tends increasingly to regulate our behavior.

73. Behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the 
    government. Control is often exercised through indirect coercion or through 
    psychological pressure or manipulation, and by organizations other than the 
    government, or by the system as a whole. Most large organizations use some 
    form of propaganda [14] to manipulate public attitudes or behavior. 
    Propaganda is not limited to “commercials” and advertisements, and sometimes 
    it is not even consciously intended as propaganda by the people who make it. 
    For instance, the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of 
    propaganda. An example of indirect coercion: There is no law that says we 
    have to go to work every day and follow our employer’s orders. Legally there 
    is nothing to prevent us from going to live in the wild like primitive 
    people or from going into business for ourselves. But in practice there is 
    very little wild country left, and there is room in the economy for only 
    a limited number of small business owners. Hence most of us can survive only 
    as someone else’s employee.

74. We suggest that modern man’s obsession with longevity, and with maintaining 
    physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of 
    unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process. 
    The “mid-life crisis” also is such a symptom. So is the lack of interest in 
    having children that is fairly common in modern society but almost 
    unheard-of in primitive societies.

75. In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and 
    purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular 
    reluctance about passing on to the next stage. A young man goes through the 
    power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment 
    but to get meat that is necessary for food. (In young women the process is 
    more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won’t discuss that 
    here.) This phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has 
    no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising 
    a family. (In contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having 
    children because they are too busy seeking some kind of “fulfillment.” We 
    suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power 
    process—with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate 
    activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, going through 
    the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the 
    primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old 
    age (if he survives that long) and death. Many modern people, on the other 
    hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as 
    is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their 
    physical condition, appearance and health. We argue that this is due to 
    unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their 
    physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power 
    process using their bodies in a serious way. It is not the primitive man, 
    who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the 
    deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use 
    for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose 
    need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best 
    prepared to accept the end of that life.

76. In response to the arguments of this section someone will say, “Society must 
    find a way to give people the opportunity to go through the power process.” 
    For such people the value of the opportunity is destroyed by the very fact 
    that society gives it to them. What they need is to find or make their own 
    opportunities. As long as the system GIVES them their opportunities it still 
    has them on a leash. To attain autonomy they must get off that leash.

HOW SOME PEOPLE ADJUST

77. Not everyone in industrial-technological society suffers from psychological 
    problems. Some people even profess to be quite satisfied with society as it 
    is. We now discuss some of the reasons why people differ so greatly in their 
    response to modern society.

78. First, there doubtless are differences in the strength of the drive for 
    power. Individuals with a weak drive for power may have relatively little 
    need to go through the power process, or at least relatively little need for 
    autonomy in the power process. These are docile types who would have been 
    happy as plantation darkies in the Old South. (We don’t mean to sneer at the 
    “plantation darkies” of the Old South. To their credit, most of the slaves 
    were NOT content with their servitude. We do sneer at people who ARE content 
    with servitude.)

79. Some people may have some exceptional drive, in pursuing which they satisfy 
    their need for the power process. For example, those who have an unusually 
    strong drive for social status may spend their whole lives climbing the 
    status ladder without ever getting bored with that game.

80. People vary in their susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. 
    Some are so susceptible that, even if they make a great deal of money, they 
    cannot satisfy their constant craving for the the shiny new toys that the 
    marketing industry dangles before their eyes. So they always feel 
    hard-pressed financially even if their income is large, and their cravings 
    are frustrated.

81. Some people have low susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. 
    These are the people who aren’t interested in money. Material acquisition 
    does not serve their need for the power process.

82. People who have medium susceptibility to advertising and marketing 
    techniques are able to earn enough money to satisfy their craving for goods 
    and services, but only at the cost of serious effort (putting in overtime, 
    taking a second job, earning promotions, etc.). Thus material acquisition 
    serves their need for the power process. But it does not necessarily follow 
    that their need is fully satisfied. They may have insufficient autonomy in 
    the power process (their work may consist of following orders) and some of 
    their drives may be frustrated (e.g., security, aggression). (We are guilty 
    of oversimplification in paragraphs 80- 82 because we have assumed that the 
    desire for material acquisition is entirely a creation of the advertising 
    and marketing industry. Of course it’s not that simple. [11]

83. Some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves 
    with a powerful organization or mass movement. An individual lacking goals 
    or power joins a movement or an organization, adopts its goals as his own, 
    then works toward those goals. When some of the goals are attained, the 
    individual, even though his personal efforts have played only an 
    insignificant part in the attainment of the goals, feels (through his 
    identification with the movement or organization) as if he had gone through 
    the power process. This phenomenon was exploited by the fascists, nazis and 
    communists. Our society uses it too, though less crudely. Example: Manuel 
    Noriega was an irritant to the U.S. (goal: punish Noriega). The U.S. invaded 
    Panama (effort) and punished Noriega (attainment of goal). Thus the U.S. 
    went through the power process and many Americans, because of their 
    identification with the U.S., experienced the power process vicariously. 
    Hence the widespread public approval of the Panama invasion; it gave people 
    a sense of power. [15] We see the same phenomenon in armies, corporations, 
    political parties, humanitarian organizations, religious or ideological 
    movements. In particular, leftist movements tend to attract people who are 
    seeking to satisfy their need for power. But for most people identification 
    with a large organization or a mass movement does not fully satisfy the need 
    for power.

84. Another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is 
    through surrogate activities. As we explained in paragraphs 38-40, 
    a surrogate activity is an activity that is directed toward an artificial 
    goal that the individual pursues for the sake of the “fulfillment” that he 
    gets from pursuing the goal, not because he needs to attain the goal itself. 
    For instance, there is no practical motive for building enormous muscles, 
    hitting a little ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage 
    stamps. Yet many people in our society devote themselves with passion to 
    bodybuilding, golf or stamp-collecting. Some people are more 
    “other-directed” than others, and therefore will more readily attach 
    importance to a surrogate activity simply because the people around them 
    treat it as important or because society tells them it is important. That is 
    why some people get very serious about essentially trivial activities such 
    as sports, or bridge, or chess, or arcane scholarly pursuits, whereas others 
    who are more clear-sighted never see these things as anything but the 
    surrogate activities that they are, and consequently never attach enough 
    importance to them to satisfy their need for the power process in that way. 
    It only remains to point out that in many cases a person’s way of earning 
    a living is also a surrogate activity. Not a PURE surrogate activity, since 
    part of the motive for the activity is to gain the physical necessities and 
    (for some people) social status and the luxuries that advertising makes them 
    want. But many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary 
    to earn whatever money and status they require, and this extra effort 
    constitutes a surrogate activity. This extra effort, together with the 
    emotional investment that accompanies it, is one of the most potent forces 
    acting toward the continual development and perfecting of the system, with 
    negative consequences for individual freedom (see paragraph 131). 
    Especially, for the most creative scientists and engineers, work tends to be 
    largely a surrogate activity. This point is so important that it deserves 
    a separate discussion, which we shall give in a moment (paragraphs 87-92).

85. In this section we have explained how many people in modern society do 
    satisfy their need for the power process to a greater or lesser extent. But 
    we think that for the majority of people the need for the power process is 
    not fully satisfied. In the first place, those who have an insatiable drive 
    for status, or who get firmly “hooked” on a surrogate activity, or who 
    identify strongly enough with a movement or organization to satisfy their 
    need for power in that way, are exceptional personalities. Others are not 
    fully satisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an 
    organization (see paragraphs 41, 64). In the second place, too much control 
    is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through 
    socialization, which results in a deficiency of autonomy, and in frustration 
    due to the impossibility of attaining certain goals and the necessity of 
    restraining too many impulses.

86. But even if most people in industrial-technological society were well 
    satisfied, we (FC) would still be opposed to that form of society, because 
    (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one’s need for the 
    power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an 
    organization, rather than through pursuit of real goals.

THE MOTIVES OF SCIENTISTS

87. Science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate 
    activities. Some scientists claim that they are motivated by “curiosity” or 
    by a desire to “benefit humanity.” But it is easy to see that neither of 
    these can be the principal motive of most scientists. As for “curiosity,” 
    that notion is simply absurd. Most scientists work on highly specialized 
    problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. For example, is an 
    astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties 
    of isopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not. Only a chemist is curious about 
    such a thing, and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his 
    surrogate activity. Is the chemist curious about the appropriate 
    classification of a new species of beetle? No. That question is of interest 
    only to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only because entomology 
    is his surrogate activity. If the chemist and the entomologist had to exert 
    themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort 
    exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific 
    pursuit, then they wouldn’t give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or 
    the classification of beetles. Suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate 
    education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of 
    a chemist. In that case he would have been very interested in insurance 
    matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. In any 
    case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the 
    amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. The 
    “curiosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’t stand up.

88. The “benefit of humanity” explanation doesn’t work any better. Some 
    scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human 
    race—most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for example. Some other 
    areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities. Yet scientists 
    in these areas are just as enthusiastic about their work as those who 
    develop vaccines or study air pollution. Consider the case of Dr. Edward 
    Teller, who had an obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclear power 
    plants. Did this involvement stem from a desire to benefit humanity? If so, 
    then why didn’t Dr. Teller get emotional about other “humanitarian” causes? 
    If he was such a humanitarian then why did he help to develop the H- bomb? 
    As with many other scientific achievements, it is very much open to question 
    whether nuclear power plants actually do benefit humanity. Does the cheap 
    electricity outweigh the accumulating waste and the risk of accidents? Dr. 
    Teller saw only one side of the question. Clearly his emotional involvement 
    with nuclear power arose not from a desire to “benefit humanity” but from 
    a personal fulfillment he got from his work and from seeing it put to 
    practical use.

89. The same is true of scientists generally. With possible rare exceptions, 
    their motive is neither curiosity nor a desire to benefit humanity but the 
    need to go through the power process: to have a goal (a scientific problem 
    to solve), to make an effort (research) and to attain the goal (solution of 
    the problem.) Science is a surrogate activity because scientists work mainly 
    for the fulfillment they get out of the work itself.

90. Of course, it’s not that simple. Other motives do play a role for many 
    scientists. Money and status for example. Some scientists may be persons of 
    the type who have an insatiable drive for status (see paragraph 79) and this 
    may provide much of the motivation for their work. No doubt the majority of 
    scientists, like the majority of the general population, are more or less 
    susceptible to advertising and marketing techniques and need money to 
    satisfy their craving for goods and services. Thus science is not a PURE 
    surrogate activity. But it is in large part a surrogate activity.

91. Also, science and technology constitute a power mass movement, and many 
    scientists gratify their need for power through identification with this 
    mass movement (see paragraph 83).

92. Thus science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the 
    human race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological 
    needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation 
    executives who provide the funds for research.

THE NATURE OF FREEDOM

93. We are going to argue that industrial-technological society cannot be 
    reformed in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing the 
    sphere of human freedom. But, because “freedom” is a word that can be 
    interpreted in many ways, we must first make clear what kind of freedom we 
    are concerned with.

94. By “freedom” we mean the opportunity to go through the power process, with 
    real goals not the artificial goals of surrogate activities, and without 
    interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone, especially from any 
    large organization. Freedom means being in control (either as an individual 
    or as a member of a SMALL group) of the life-and-death issues of one’s 
    existence; food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats 
    there may be in one’s environment. Freedom means having power; not the power 
    to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one’s 
    own life. One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large 
    organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and 
    permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse 
    freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72).

95. It is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number 
    of constitutionally guaranteed rights. But these are not as important as 
    they seem. The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is 
    determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society 
    than by its laws or its form of government. [16] Most of the Indian nations 
    of New England were monarchies, and many of the cities of the Italian 
    Renaissance were controlled by dictators. But in reading about these 
    societies one gets the impression that they allowed far more personal 
    freedom than our society does. In part this was because they lacked 
    efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler’s will: There were no modern, 
    well-organized police forces, no rapid long-distance communications, no 
    surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about the lives of average 
    citizens. Hence it was relatively easy to evade control.

96. As for our constitutional rights, consider for example that of freedom of 
    the press. We certainly don’t mean to knock that right; it is very important 
    tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who 
    do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on 
    their part. But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average 
    citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control of 
    large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has 
    a little money can have something printed, or can distribute it on the 
    Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say will be swamped by the 
    vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no 
    practical effect. To make an impression on society with words is therefore 
    almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for 
    example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present 
    writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they 
    had been been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted 
    many readers, because it’s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by 
    the media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had many 
    readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read 
    as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media 
    expose them. In order to get our message before the public with some chance 
    of making a lasting impression, we’ve had to kill people.

97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to 
    guarantee much more than what might be called the bourgeois conception of 
    freedom. According to the bourgeois conception, a “free” man is essentially 
    an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and 
    delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the 
    social machine more than those of the individual. Thus the bourgeois’s 
    “free” man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and progress; 
    he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior 
    by political leaders; he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at 
    the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. This was clearly the 
    attitude of Simon Bolivar. To him, people deserved liberty only if they used 
    it to promote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois). Other 
    bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a mere means to 
    collective ends. Chester C. Tan, “Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth 
    Century,” page 202, explains the philosophy of the Kuomintang leader Hu 
    Han-min: “An individual is granted rights because he is a member of society 
    and his community life requires such rights. By community Hu meant the whole 
    society of the nation.” And on page 259 Tan states that according to Carsum 
    Chang (Chang Chun-mai, head of the State Socialist Party in China) freedom 
    had to be used in the interest of the state and of the people as a whole. 
    But what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone 
    else prescribes? FC’s conception of freedom is not that of Bolivar, Hu, 
    Chang or other bourgeois theorists. The trouble with such theorists is that 
    they have made the development and application of social theories their 
    surrogate activity. Consequently the theories are designed to serve the 
    needs of the theorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky 
    enough to live in a society on which the theories are imposed.

98. One more point to be made in this section: It should not be assumed that 
    a person has enough freedom just because he SAYS he has enough. Freedom is 
    restricted in part by psychological controls of which people are 
    unconscious, and moreover many people’s ideas of what constitutes freedom 
    are governed more by social convention than by their real needs. For 
    example, it’s likely that many leftists of the oversocialized type would say 
    that most people, including themselves, are socialized too little rather 
    than too much, yet the oversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological 
    price for his high level of socialization.

SOME PRINCIPLES OF HISTORY

99. Think of history as being the sum of two components: an erratic component 
    that consists of unpredictable events that follow no discernible pattern, 
    and a regular component that consists of long-term historical trends. Here 
    we are concerned with the long-term trends.

100. FIRST PRINCIPLE. If a SMALL change is made that affects a long-term 
     historical trend, then the effect of that change will almost always be 
     transitory—the trend will soon revert to its original state. (Example: 
     A reform movement designed to clean up political corruption in a society 
     rarely has more than a short-term effect; sooner or later the reformers 
     relax and corruption creeps back in. The level of political corruption in 
     a given society tends to remain constant, or to change only slowly with the 
     evolution of the society. Normally, a political cleanup will be permanent 
     only if accompanied by widespread social changes; a SMALL change in the 
     society won’t be enough.) If a small change in a long-term historical trend 
     appears to be permanent, it is only because the change acts in the 
     direction in which the trend is already moving, so that the trend is not 
     altered by only pushed a step ahead.

101. The first principle is almost a tautology. If a trend were not stable with 
     respect to small changes, it would wander at random rather than following 
     a definite direction; in other words it would not be a long- term trend at 
     all.

102. SECOND PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter 
     permanently a long-term historical trend, then it will alter the society as 
     a whole. In other words, a society is a system in which all parts are 
     interrelated, and you can’t permanently change any important part without 
     changing all other parts as well.

103. THIRD PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is large enough to alter 
     permanently a long-term trend, then the consequences for the society as 
     a whole cannot be predicted in advance. (Unless various other societies 
     have passed through the same change and have all experienced the same 
     consequences, in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that 
     another society that passes through the same change will be like to 
     experience similar consequences.)

104. FOURTH PRINCIPLE. A new kind of society cannot be designed on paper. That 
     is, you cannot plan out a new form of society in advance, then set it up 
     and expect it to function as it was designed to do.

105. The third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human 
     societies. A change in human behavior will affect the economy of a society 
     and its physical environment; the economy will affect the environment and 
     vice versa, and the changes in the economy and the environment will affect 
     human behavior in complex, unpredictable ways; and so forth. The network of 
     causes and effects is far too complex to be untangled and understood.

106. FIFTH PRINCIPLE. People do not consciously and rationally choose the form 
     of their society. Societies develop through processes of social evolution 
     that are not under rational human control.

107. The fifth principle is a consequence of the other four.

108. To illustrate: By the first principle, generally speaking an attempt at 
     social reform either acts in the direction in which the society is 
     developing anyway (so that it merely accelerates a change that would have 
     occurred in any case) or else it has only a transitory effect, so that the 
     society soon slips back into its old groove. To make a lasting change in 
     the direction of development of any important aspect of a society, reform 
     is insufficient and revolution is required. (A revolution does not 
     necessarily involve an armed uprising or the overthrow of a government.) By 
     the second principle, a revolution never changes only one aspect of 
     a society, it changes the whole society; and by the third principle changes 
     occur that were never expected or desired by the revolutionaries. By the 
     fourth principle, when revolutionaries or utopians set up a new kind of 
     society, it never works out as planned.

109. The American Revolution does not provide a counterexample. The American 
     “Revolution” was not a revolution in our sense of the word, but a war of 
     independence followed by a rather far-reaching political reform. The 
     Founding Fathers did not change the direction of development of American 
     society, nor did they aspire to do so. They only freed the development of 
     American society from the retarding effect of British rule. Their political 
     reform did not change any basic trend, but only pushed American political 
     culture along its natural direction of development. British society, of 
     which American society was an offshoot, had been moving for a long time in 
     the direction of representative democracy. And prior to the War of 
     Independence the Americans were already practicing a significant degree of 
     representative democracy in the colonial assemblies. The political system 
     established by the Constitution was modeled on the British system and on 
     the colonial assemblies. With major alteration, to be sure—there is no 
     doubt that the Founding Fathers took a very important step. But it was 
     a step along the road that English-speaking world was already traveling. 
     The proof is that Britain and all of its colonies that were populated 
     predominantly by people of British descent ended up with systems of 
     representative democracy essentially similar to that of the United States. 
     If the Founding Fathers had lost their nerve and declined to sign the 
     Declaration of Independence, our way of life today would not have been 
     significantly different. Maybe we would have had somewhat closer ties to 
     Britain, and would have had a Parliament and Prime Minister instead of 
     a Congress and President. No big deal. Thus the American Revolution 
     provides not a counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of 
     them.

110. Still, one has to use common sense in applying the principles. They are 
     expressed in imprecise language that allows latitude for interpretation, 
     and exceptions to them can be found. So we present these principles not as 
     inviolable laws but as rules of thumb, or guides to thinking, that may 
     provide a partial antidote to naive ideas about the future of society. The 
     principles should be borne constantly in mind, and whenever one reaches 
     a conclusion that conflicts with them one should carefully reexamine one’s 
     thinking and retain the conclusion only if one has good, solid reasons for 
     doing so.

    INDUSTRIAL-TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY CANNOT BE REFORMED

111. The foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult it would be 
     to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from 
     progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom. There has been a consistent 
     tendency, going back at least to the Industrial Revolution for technology 
     to strengthen the system at a high cost in individual freedom and local 
     autonomy. Hence any change designed to protect freedom from technology 
     would be contrary to a fundamental trend in the development of our society. 
     Consequently, such a change either would be a transitory one—soon swamped 
     by the tide of history—or, if large enough to be permanent would alter the 
     nature of our whole society. This by the first and second principles. 
     Moreover, since society would be altered in a way that could not be 
     predicted in advance (third principle) there would be great risk. Changes 
     large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be 
     initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the 
     system. So any attempts at reform would be too timid to be effective. Even 
     if changes large enough to make a lasting difference were initiated, they 
     would be retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent. Thus, 
     permanent changes in favor of freedom could be brought about only by 
     persons prepared to accept radical, dangerous and unpredictable alteration 
     of the entire system. In other words by revolutionaries, not reformers.

112. People anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed benefits 
     of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of society that 
     would reconcile freedom with technology. Apart from the fact that people 
     who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the 
     new form of society could be set up in the first place, it follows from the 
     fourth principle that even if the new form of society could be once 
     established, it either would collapse or would give results very different 
     from those expected.

113. So even on very general grounds it seems highly improbable that any way of 
     changing society could be found that would reconcile freedom with modern 
     technology. In the next few sections we will give more specific reasons for 
     concluding that freedom and technological progress are incompatible.

RESTRICTION OF FREEDOM IS UNAVOIDABLE IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY

114. As explained in paragraphs 65-67, 70-73, modern man is strapped down by 
     a network of rules and regulations, and his fate depends on the actions of 
     persons remote from him whose decisions he cannot influence. This is not 
     accidental or a result of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. It is 
     necessary and inevitable in any technologically advanced society. The 
     system HAS TO regulate human behavior closely in order to function. At work 
     people have to do what they are told to do, otherwise production would be 
     thrown into chaos. Bureaucracies HAVE TO be run according to rigid rules. 
     To allow any substantial personal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats 
     would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to 
     differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion. 
     It is true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated, but 
     GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of our lives by large organizations is 
     necessary for the functioning of industrial-technological society. The 
     result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person. It 
     may be, however, that formal regulations will tend increasingly to be 
     replaced by psychological tools that make us want to do what the system 
     requires of us. (Propaganda [14], educational techniques, “mental health” 
     programs, etc.)

115. The system HAS TO force people to behave in ways that are increasingly 
     remote from the natural pattern of human behavior. For example, the system 
     needs scientists, mathematicians and engineers. It can’t function without 
     them. So heavy pressure is put on children to excel in these fields. It 
     isn’t natural for an adolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time 
     sitting at a desk absorbed in study. A normal adolescent wants to spend his 
     time in active contact with the real world. Among primitive peoples the 
     things that children are trained to do tend to be in reasonable harmony 
     with natural human impulses. Among the American Indians, for example, boys 
     were trained in active outdoor pursuits—just the sort of thing that boys 
     like. But in our society children are pushed into studying technical 
     subjects, which most do grudgingly.

116. Because of the constant pressure that the system exerts to modify human 
     behavior, there is a gradual increase in the number of people who cannot or 
     will not adjust to society’s requirements: welfare leeches, youth-gang 
     members, cultists, anti-government rebels, radical environmentalist 
     saboteurs, dropouts and resisters of various kinds.

117. In any technologically advanced society the individual’s fate MUST depend 
     on decisions that he personally cannot influence to any great extent. 
     A technological society cannot be broken down into small, autonomous 
     communities, because production depends on the cooperation of very large 
     numbers of people and machines. Such a society MUST be highly organized and 
     decisions HAVE TO be made that affect very large numbers of people. When 
     a decision affects, say, a million people, then each of the affected 
     individuals has, on the average, only a one-millionth share in making the 
     decision. What usually happens in practice is that decisions are made by 
     public officials or corporation executives, or by technical specialists, 
     but even when the public votes on a decision the number of voters 
     ordinarily is too large for the vote of any one individual to be 
     significant. [17] Thus most individuals are unable to influence measurably 
     the major decisions that affect their lives. There is no conceivable way to 
     remedy this in a technologically advanced society. The system tries to 
     “solve” this problem by using propaganda to make people WANT the decisions 
     that have been made for them, but even if this “solution” were completely 
     successful in making people feel better, it would be demeaning.

118. Conservatives and some others advocate more “local autonomy.” Local 
     communities once did have autonomy, but such autonomy becomes less and less 
     possible as local communities become more enmeshed with and dependent on 
     large-scale systems like public utilities, computer networks, highway 
     systems, the mass communications media, the modern health care system. Also 
     operating against autonomy is the fact that technology applied in one 
     location often affects people at other locations far way. Thus pesticide or 
     chemical use near a creek may contaminate the water supply hundreds of 
     miles downstream, and the greenhouse effect affects the whole world.

119. The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is 
     human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system. This 
     has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to 
     guide the technological system. It is the fault of technology, because the 
     system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity. [18] Of course 
     the system does satisfy many human needs, but generally speaking it does 
     this only to the extend that it is to the advantage of the system to do it. 
     It is the needs of the system that are paramount, not those of the human 
     being. For example, the system provides people with food because the system 
     couldn’t function if everyone starved; it attends to people’s psychological 
     needs whenever it can CONVENIENTLY do so, because it couldn’t function if 
     too many people became depressed or rebellious. But the system, for good, 
     solid, practical reasons, must exert constant pressure on people to mold 
     their behavior to the needs of the system. To much waste accumulating? The 
     government, the media, the educational system, environmentalists, everyone 
     inundates us with a mass of propaganda about recycling. Need more technical 
     personnel? A chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science. No one stops 
     to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of 
     their time studying subjects most of them hate. When skilled workers are 
     put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo “retraining,” no 
     one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this 
     way. It is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical 
     necessity. and for good reason: If human needs were put before technical 
     necessity there would be economic problems, unemployment, shortages or 
     worse. The concept of “mental health” in our society is defined largely by 
     the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the 
     system and does so without showing signs of stress.

120. Efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within the 
     system are no better than a joke. For example, one company, instead of 
     having each of its employees assemble only one section of a catalogue, had 
     each assemble a whole catalogue, and this was supposed to give them a sense 
     of purpose and achievement. Some companies have tried to give their 
     employees more autonomy in their work, but for practical reasons this 
     usually can be done only to a very limited extent, and in any case 
     employees are never given autonomy as to ultimate goals—their “autonomous” 
     efforts can never be directed toward goals that they select personally, but 
     only toward their employer’s goals, such as the survival and growth of the 
     company. Any company would soon go out of business if it permitted its 
     employees to act otherwise. Similarly, in any enterprise within a socialist 
     system, workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of the 
     enterprise, otherwise the enterprise will not serve its purpose as part of 
     the system. Once again, for purely technical reasons it is not possible for 
     most individuals or small groups to have much autonomy in industrial 
     society. Even the small-business owner commonly has only limited autonomy. 
     Apart from the necessity of government regulation, he is restricted by the 
     fact that he must fit into the economic system and conform to its 
     requirements. For instance, when someone develops a new technology, the 
     small-business person often has to use that technology whether he wants to 
     or not, in order to remain competitive.

THE ‘BAD’ PARTS OF TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE ‘GOOD’ PARTS

121. A further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor of 
     freedom is that modern technology is a unified system in which all parts 
     are dependent on one another. You can’t get rid of the “bad” parts of 
     technology and retain only the “good” parts. Take modern medicine, for 
     example. Progress in medical science depends on progress in chemistry, 
     physics, biology, computer science and other fields. Advanced medical 
     treatments require expensive, high-tech equipment that can be made 
     available only by a technologically progressive, economically rich society. 
     Clearly you can’t have much progress in medicine without the whole 
     technological system and everything that goes with it.

122. Even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest of the 
     technological system, it would by itself bring certain evils. Suppose for 
     example that a cure for diabetes is discovered. People with a genetic 
     tendency to diabetes will then be able to survive and reproduce as well as 
     anyone else. Natural selection against genes for diabetes will cease and 
     such genes will spread throughout the population. (This may be occurring to 
     some extent already, since diabetes, while not curable, can be controlled 
     through use of insulin.) The same thing will happen with many other 
     diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic degradation of the 
     population. The only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or 
     extensive genetic engineering of human beings, so that man in the future 
     will no longer be a creation of nature, or of chance, or of God (depending 
     on your religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product.

123. If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW, just 
     wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your 
     children. Such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of 
     genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of 
     unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous. [19]

124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about “medical ethics.” But 
     a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical 
     progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of ethics applicable to 
     genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic 
     constitution of human beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, 
     mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering 
     were “ethical” and others were not, so that in effect they would be 
     imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at 
     large. Even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic 
     basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities 
     who might have a different idea of what constituted an “ethical” use of 
     genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly protect 
     freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human 
     beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in 
     a technological society. No code that reduced genetic engineering to 
     a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by 
     the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since 
     to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and 
     unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people 
     the abilities they need to get along in today’s world). Inevitably, genetic 
     engineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the 
     needs of the industrial- technological system. [20]

TECHNOLOGY IS A MORE POWERFUL SOCIAL FORCE THAN THE ASPIRATION FOR FREEDOM

125. It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and 
     freedom, because technology is by far the more powerful social force and 
     continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises. Imagine the 
     case of two neighbors, each of whom at the outset owns the same amount of 
     land, but one of whom is more powerful than the other. The powerful one 
     demands a piece of the other’s land. The weak one refuses. The powerful one 
     says, “OK, let’s compromise. Give me half of what I asked.” The weak one 
     has little choice but to give in. Some time later the powerful neighbor 
     demands another piece of land, again there is a compromise, and so forth. 
     By forcing a long series of compromises on the weaker man, the powerful one 
     eventually gets all of his land. So it goes in the conflict between 
     technology and freedom.

126. Let us explain why technology is a more powerful social force than the 
     aspiration for freedom.

127. A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns 
     out to threaten it very seriously later on. For example, consider motorized 
     transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own 
     pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of 
     technological support-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they 
     appeared to increase man’s freedom. They took no freedom away from the 
     walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn’t want one, and 
     anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and 
     farther than a walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport 
     soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man’s freedom of 
     locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to 
     regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated 
     areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one’s own pace one’s movement 
     is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied 
     down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing 
     registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments 
     on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer 
     optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of 
     our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer 
     live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas 
     and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the 
     automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, 
     in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when 
     driving a car. Even the walker’s freedom is now greatly restricted. In the 
     city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are 
     designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes 
     it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this important 
     point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: 
     When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual 
     can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. 
     In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people 
     eventually find themselves FORCED to use it.)

128. While technological progress AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere of 
     freedom, each new technical advance CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be 
     desirable. Electricity, indoor plumbing, rapid long-distance communications 
     ... how could one argue against any of these things, or against any other 
     of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern society? It 
     would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone, for 
     example. It offered many advantages and no disadvantages. Yet, as we 
     explained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together 
     have created a world in which the average man’s fate is no longer in his 
     own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in those of 
     politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and 
     bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence. [21] The 
     same process will continue in the future. Take genetic engineering, for 
     example. Few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique 
     that eliminates a hereditary disease. It does no apparent harm and prevents 
     much suffering. Yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together 
     will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free 
     creation of chance (or of God, or whatever, depending on your religious 
     beliefs).

129. Another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that, 
     within the context of a given society, technological progress marches in 
     only one direction; it can never be reversed. Once a technical innovation 
     has been introduced, people usually become dependent on it, so that they 
     can never again do without it, unless it is replaced by some still more 
     advanced innovation. Not only do people become dependent as individuals on 
     a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes 
     dependent on it. (Imagine what would happen to the system today if 
     computers, for example, were eliminated.) Thus the system can move in only 
     one direction, toward greater technologization. Technology repeatedly 
     forces freedom to take a step back, but technology can never take a step 
     back—short of the overthrow of the whole technological system.

130. Technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many 
     different points at the same time (crowding, rules and regulations, 
     increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations, propaganda and 
     other psychological techniques, genetic engineering, invasion of privacy 
     through surveillance devices and computers, etc.). To hold back any ONE of 
     the threats to freedom would require a long and difficult social struggle. 
     Those who want to protect freedom are overwhelmed by the sheer number of 
     new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop, hence they become 
     apathetic and no longer resist. To fight each of the threats separately 
     would be futile. Success can be hoped for only by fighting the 
     technological system as a whole; but that is revolution, not reform.

131. Technicians (we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who 
     perform a specialized task that requires training) tend to be so involved 
     in their work (their surrogate activity) that when a conflict arises 
     between their technical work and freedom, they almost always decide in 
     favor of their technical work. This is obvious in the case of scientists, 
     but it also appears elsewhere: Educators, humanitarian groups, conservation 
     organizations do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological 
     techniques to help them achieve their laudable ends. Corporations and 
     government agencies, when they find it useful, do not hesitate to collect 
     information about individuals without regard to their privacy. Law 
     enforcement agencies are frequently inconvenienced by the constitutional 
     rights of suspects and often of completely innocent persons, and they do 
     whatever they can do legally (or sometimes illegally) to restrict or 
     circumvent those rights. Most of these educators, government officials and 
     law officers believe in freedom, privacy and constitutional rights, but 
     when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is 
     more important.

132. It is well known that people generally work better and more persistently 
     when striving for a reward than when attempting to avoid a punishment or 
     negative outcome. Scientists and other technicians are motivated mainly by 
     the rewards they get through their work. But those who oppose technological 
     invasions of freedom are working to avoid a negative outcome, consequently 
     there are few who work persistently and well at this discouraging task. If 
     reformers ever achieved a signal victory that seemed to set up a solid 
     barrier against further erosion of freedom through technical progress, most 
     would tend to relax and turn their attention to more agreeable pursuits. 
     But the scientists would remain busy in their laboratories, and technology 
     as it progresses would find ways, in spite of any barriers, to exert more 
     and more control over individuals and make them always more dependent on 
     the system.

133. No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical 
     codes, can provide permanent protection against technology. History shows 
     that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or break down 
     eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of 
     a given civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to arrive 
     at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from 
     being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such 
     a way as to threaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would 
     remain waiting. Sooner or later the social arrangement would break down. 
     Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic 
     engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion 
     would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of technological civilization 
     itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social 
     arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with 
     environmental legislation. A few years ago its seemed that there were 
     secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of 
     environmental degradation. A change in the political wind, and those 
     barriers begin to crumble.

134. For all of the foregoing reasons, technology is a more powerful social 
     force than the aspiration for freedom. But this statement requires an 
     important qualification. It appears that during the next several decades 
     the industrial-technological system will be undergoing severe stresses due 
     to economic and environmental problems, and especially due to problems of 
     human behavior (alienation, rebellion, hostility, a variety of social and 
     psychological difficulties). We hope that the stresses through which the 
     system is likely to pass will cause it to break down, or at least will 
     weaken it sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes possible. If 
     such a revolution occurs and is successful, then at that particular moment 
     the aspiration for freedom will have proved more powerful than technology.

135. In paragraph 125 we used an analogy of a weak neighbor who is left 
     destitute by a strong neighbor who takes all his land by forcing on him 
     a series of compromises. But suppose now that the strong neighbor gets 
     sick, so that he is unable to defend himself. The weak neighbor can force 
     the strong one to give him his land back, or he can kill him. If he lets 
     the strong man survive and only forces him to give the land back, he is 
     a fool, because when the strong man gets well he will again take all the 
     land for himself. The only sensible alternative for the weaker man is to 
     kill the strong one while he has the chance. In the same way, while the 
     industrial system is sick we must destroy it. If we compromise with it and 
     let it recover from its sickness, it will eventually wipe out all of our 
     freedom.

SIMPLER SOCIAL PROBLEMS HAVE PROVED INTRACTABLE

136. If anyone still imagines that it would be possible to reform the system in 
     such a way as to protect freedom from technology, let him consider how 
     clumsily and for the most part unsuccessfully our society has dealt with 
     other social problems that are far more simple and straightforward. Among 
     other things, the system has failed to stop environmental degradation, 
     political corruption, drug trafficking or domestic abuse.

137. Take our environmental problems, for example. Here the conflict of values 
     is straightforward: economic expedience now versus saving some of our 
     natural resources for our grandchildren. [22] But on this subject we get 
     only a lot of blather and obfuscation from the people who have power, and 
     nothing like a clear, consistent line of action, and we keep on piling up 
     environmental problems that our grandchildren will have to live with. 
     Attempts to resolve the environmental issue consist of struggles and 
     compromises between different factions, some of which are ascendant at one 
     moment, others at another moment. The line of struggle changes with the 
     shifting currents of public opinion. This is not a rational process, nor is 
     it one that is likely to lead to a timely and successful solution to the 
     problem. Major social problems, if they get “solved” at all, are rarely or 
     never solved through any rational, comprehensive plan. They just work 
     themselves out through a process in which various competing groups pursuing 
     their own (usually short- term) self-interest [23] arrive (mainly by luck) 
     at some more or less stable modus vivendi. In fact, the principles we 
     formulated in paragraphs 100-106 make it seem doubtful that rational, 
     long-term social planning can EVER be successful.

138. Thus it is clear that the human race has at best a very limited capacity 
     for solving even relatively straightforward social problems. How then is it 
     going to solve the far more difficult and subtle problem of reconciling 
     freedom with technology? Technology presents clear-cut material advantages, 
     whereas freedom is an abstraction that means different things to different 
     people, and its loss is easily obscured by propaganda and fancy talk.

139. And note this important difference: It is conceivable that our 
     environmental problems (for example) may some day be settled through 
     a rational, comprehensive plan, but if this happens it will be only because 
     it is in the long-term interest of the system to solve these problems. But 
     it is NOT in the interest of the system to preserve freedom or small-group 
     autonomy. On the contrary, it is in the interest of the system to bring 
     human behavior under control to the greatest possible extent. [24] Thus, 
     while practical considerations may eventually force the system to take 
     a rational, prudent approach to environmental problems, equally practical 
     considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior ever more 
     closely (preferably by indirect means that will disguise the encroachment 
     on freedom). This isn’t just our opinion. Eminent social scientists (e.g. 
     James Q. Wilson) have stressed the importance of “socializing” people more 
     effectively.

REVOLUTION IS EASIER THAN REFORM

140. We hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in 
     such a way as to reconcile freedom with technology. The only way out is to 
     dispense with the industrial-technological system altogether. This implies 
     revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but certainly a radical and 
     fundamental change in the nature of society.

141. People tend to assume that because a revolution involves a much greater 
     change than reform does, it is more difficult to bring about than reform 
     is. Actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than 
     reform. The reason is that a revolutionary movement can inspire an 
     intensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire. A reform 
     movement merely offers to solve a particular social problem. 
     A revolutionary movement offers to solve all problems at one stroke and 
     create a whole new world; it provides the kind of ideal for which people 
     will take great risks and make great sacrifices. For this reasons it would 
     be much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to put 
     effective, permanent restraints on the development or application of any 
     one segment of technology, such as genetic engineering, for example. Not 
     many people will devote themselves with single-minded passion to imposing 
     and maintaining restraints on genetic engineering, but under suitable 
     conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves passionately to 
     a revolution against the industrial-technological system. As we noted in 
     paragraph 132, reformers seeking to limit certain aspects of technology 
     would be working to avoid a negative outcome. But revolutionaries work to 
     gain a powerful reward—fulfillment of their revolutionary vision—and 
     therefore work harder and more persistently than reformers do.

142. Reform is always restrained by the fear of painful consequences if changes 
     go too far. But once a revolutionary fever has taken hold of a society, 
     people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships for the sake of their 
     revolution. This was clearly shown in the French and Russian Revolutions. 
     It may be that in such cases only a minority of the population is really 
     committed to the revolution, but this minority is sufficiently large and 
     active so that it becomes the dominant force in society. We will have more 
     to say about revolution in paragraphs 180-205.

CONTROL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR

143. Since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to put 
     pressures on human beings of the sake of the functioning of the social 
     organism. The kinds of pressures vary greatly from one society to another. 
     Some of the pressures are physical (poor diet, excessive labor, 
     environmental pollution), some are psychological (noise, crowding, forcing 
     human behavior into the mold that society requires). In the past, human 
     nature has been approximately constant, or at any rate has varied only 
     within certain bounds. Consequently, societies have been able to push 
     people only up to certain limits. When the limit of human endurance has 
     been passed, things start going wrong: rebellion, or crime, or corruption, 
     or evasion of work, or depression and other mental problems, or an elevated 
     death rate, or a declining birth rate or something else, so that either the 
     society breaks down, or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is 
     (quickly or gradually, through conquest, attrition or evolution) replaced 
     by some more efficient form of society. [25]

144. Thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of 
     societies. People could be pushed only so far and no farther. But today 
     this may be changing, because modern technology is developing ways of 
     modifying human beings.

145. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them 
     terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. 
     Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society. 
     It is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly 
     increasing in recent decades. We believe that this is due to disruption of 
     the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76. But even if we are 
     wrong, the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of SOME 
     conditions that exist in today’s society. Instead of removing the 
     conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them 
     antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying 
     an individual’s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate 
     social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable. (Yes, we know 
     that depression is often of purely genetic origin. We are referring here to 
     those cases in which environment plays the predominant role.)

146. Drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the new methods of 
     controlling human behavior that modern society is developing. Let us look 
     at some of the other methods.

147. To start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. Hidden video 
     cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places, computers are 
     used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals. 
     Information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical 
     coercion (i.e., law enforcement). [26] Then there are the methods of 
     propaganda, for which the mass communication media provide effective 
     vehicles. Efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections, 
     selling products, influencing public opinion. The entertainment industry 
     serves as an important psychological tool of the system, possibly even when 
     it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. Entertainment provides 
     modern man with an essential means of escape. While absorbed in television, 
     videos, etc., he can forget stress, anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction. 
     Many primitive peoples, when they don’t have work to do, are quite content 
     to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all, because they are at peace 
     with themselves and their world. But most modern people must be constantly 
     occupied or entertained, otherwise they get “bored,” i.e., they get 
     fidgety, uneasy, irritable.

148. Other techniques strike deeper than the foregoing. Education is no longer 
     a simple affair of paddling a kid’s behind when he doesn’t know his lessons 
     and patting him on the head when he does know them. It is becoming 
     a scientific technique for controlling the child’s development. Sylvan 
     Learning Centers, for example, have had great success in motivating 
     children to study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or 
     less success in many conventional schools. “Parenting” techniques that are 
     taught to parents are designed to make children accept fundamental values 
     of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable. “Mental 
     health” programs, “intervention” techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are 
     ostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually 
     serve as methods for inducing individuals to think and behave as the system 
     requires. (There is no contradiction here; an individual whose attitudes or 
     behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that 
     is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to 
     suffer from stress, frustration, defeat. His path will be much easier if he 
     thinks and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system is 
     acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into 
     conformity.) Child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in 
     most if not all cultures. Tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no 
     reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone. But many 
     psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly. Is 
     spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of 
     discipline, a form of abuse? The question will ultimately be decided by 
     whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit 
     in well with the existing system of society. In practice, the word “abuse” 
     tends to be interpreted to include any method of child-rearing that 
     produces behavior inconvenient for the system. Thus, when they go beyond 
     the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing 
     “child abuse” are directed toward the control of human behavior on behalf 
     of the system.

149. Presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness of 
     psychological techniques for controlling human behavior. But we think it is 
     unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be sufficient to adjust 
     human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating. Biological 
     methods probably will have to be used. We have already mentioned the use of 
     drugs in this connection. Neurology may provide other avenues for modifying 
     the human mind. Genetic engineering of human beings is already beginning to 
     occur in the form of “gene therapy,” and there is no reason to assume that 
     such methods will not eventually be used to modify those aspects of the 
     body that affect mental functioning.

150. As we mentioned in paragraph 134, industrial society seems likely to be 
     entering a period of severe stress, due in part to problems of human 
     behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems. And 
     a considerable proportion of the system’s economic and environmental 
     problems result from the way human beings behave. Alienation, low 
     self-esteem, depression, hostility, rebellion; children who won’t study, 
     youth gangs, illegal drug use, rape, child abuse, other crimes, unsafe sex, 
     teen pregnancy, population growth, political corruption, race hatred, 
     ethnic rivalry, bitter ideological conflict (e.g., pro-choice vs. pro- 
     life), political extremism, terrorism, sabotage, anti-government groups, 
     hate groups. All these threaten the very survival of the system. The system 
     will therefore be FORCED to use every practical means of controlling human 
     behavior.

151. The social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result of mere 
     chance. It can only be a result of the conditions of life that the system 
     imposes on people. (We have argued that the most important of these 
     conditions is disruption of the power process.) If the systems succeeds in 
     imposing sufficient control over human behavior to assure its own survival, 
     a new watershed in human history will have been passed. Whereas formerly 
     the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on the development of 
     societies (as we explained in paragraphs 143, 144), 
     industrial-technological society will be able to pass those limits by 
     modifying human beings, whether by psychological methods or biological 
     methods or both. In the future, social systems will not be adjusted to suit 
     the needs of human beings. Instead, human being will be adjusted to suit 
     the needs of the system. [27]

152. Generally speaking, technological control over human behavior will probably 
     not be introduced with a totalitarian intention or even through a conscious 
     desire to restrict human freedom. [28] Each new step in the assertion of 
     control over the human mind will be taken as a rational response to 
     a problem that faces society, such as curing alcoholism, reducing the crime 
     rate or inducing young people to study science and engineering. In many 
     cases there will be a humanitarian justification. For example, when 
     a psychiatrist prescribes an anti-depressant for a depressed patient, he is 
     clearly doing that individual a favor. It would be inhumane to withhold the 
     drug from someone who needs it. When parents send their children to Sylvan 
     Learning Centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about 
     their studies, they do so from concern for their children’s welfare. It may 
     be that some of these parents wish that one didn’t have to have specialized 
     training to get a job and that their kid didn’t have to be brainwashed into 
     becoming a computer nerd. But what can they do? They can’t change society, 
     and their child may be unemployable if he doesn’t have certain skills. So 
     they send him to Sylvan.

153. Thus control over human behavior will be introduced not by a calculated 
     decision of the authorities but through a process of social evolution 
     (RAPID evolution, however). The process will be impossible to resist, 
     because each advance, considered by itself, will appear to be beneficial, 
     or at least the evil involved in making the advance will appear to be 
     beneficial, or at least the evil involved in making the advance will seem 
     to be less than that which would result from not making it (see paragraph 
     127). Propaganda for example is used for many good purposes, such as 
     discouraging child abuse or race hatred. [14] Sex education is obviously 
     useful, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent that it is 
     successful) is to take the shaping of sexual attitudes away from the family 
     and put it into the hands of the state as represented by the public school 
     system.

154. Suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the likelihood that 
     a child will grow up to be a criminal, and suppose some sort of gene 
     therapy can remove this trait. [29] Of course most parents whose children 
     possess the trait will have them undergo the therapy. It would be inhumane 
     to do otherwise, since the child would probably have a miserable life if he 
     grew up to be a criminal. But many or most primitive societies have a low 
     crime rate in comparison with that of our society, even though they have 
     neither high- tech methods of child-rearing nor harsh systems of 
     punishment. Since there is no reason to suppose that more modern men than 
     primitive men have innate predatory tendencies, the high crime rate of our 
     society must be due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people, 
     to which many cannot or will not adjust. Thus a treatment designed to 
     remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of 
     re-engineering people so that they suit the requirements of the system.

155. Our society tends to regard as a “sickness” any mode of thought or behavior 
     that is inconvenient for the system, and this is plausible because when an 
     individual doesn’t fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as 
     well as problems for the system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to 
     adjust him to the system is seen as a “cure” for a “sickness” and therefore 
     as good.

156. In paragraph 127 we pointed out that if the use of a new item of technology 
     is INITIALLY optional, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional, because the 
     new technology tends to change society in such a way that it becomes 
     difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that 
     technology. This applies also to the technology of human behavior. In 
     a world in which most children are put through a program to make them 
     enthusiastic about studying, a parent will almost be forced to put his kid 
     through such a program, because if he does not, then the kid will grow up 
     to be, comparatively speaking, an ignoramus and therefore unemployable. Or 
     suppose a biological treatment is discovered that, without undesirable 
     side-effects, will greatly reduce the psychological stress from which so 
     many people suffer in our society. If large numbers of people choose to 
     undergo the treatment, then the general level of stress in society will be 
     reduced, so that it will be possible for the system to increase the 
     stress-producing pressures. In fact, something like this seems to have 
     happened already with one of our society’s most important psychological 
     tools for enabling people to reduce (or at least temporarily escape from) 
     stress, namely, mass entertainment (see paragraph 147). Our use of mass 
     entertainment is “optional”: No law requires us to watch television, listen 
     to the radio, read magazines. Yet mass entertainment is a means of escape 
     and stress-reduction on which most of us have become dependent. Everyone 
     complains about the trashiness of television, but almost everyone watches 
     it. A few have kicked the TV habit, but it would be a rare person who could 
     get along today without using ANY form of mass entertainment. (Yet until 
     quite recently in human history most people got along very nicely with no 
     other entertainment than that which each local community created for 
     itself.) Without the entertainment industry the system probably would not 
     have been able to get away with putting as much stress-producing pressure 
     on us as it does.

157. Assuming that industrial society survives, it is likely that technology 
     will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human 
     behavior. It has been established beyond any rational doubt that human 
     thought and behavior have a largely biological basis. As experimenters have 
     demonstrated, feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be 
     turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the 
     brain. Memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can 
     be brought to the surface by electrical stimulation. Hallucinations can be 
     induced or moods changed by drugs. There may or may not be an immaterial 
     human soul, but if there is one it clearly is less powerful that the 
     biological mechanisms of human behavior. For if that were not the case then 
     researchers would not be able so easily to manipulate human feelings and 
     behavior with drugs and electrical currents.

158. It presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes 
     inserted in their heads so that they could be controlled by the 
     authorities. But the fact that human thoughts and feelings are so open to 
     biological intervention shows that the problem of controlling human 
     behavior is mainly a technical problem; a problem of neurons, hormones and 
     complex molecules; the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific 
     attack. Given the outstanding record of our society in solving technical 
     problems, it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances will be made in 
     the control of human behavior.

159. Will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of 
     human behavior? It certainly would if an attempt were made to introduce 
     such control all at once. But since technological control will be 
     introduced through a long sequence of small advances, there will be no 
     rational and effective public resistance. (See paragraphs 127, 132, 153.)

160. To those who think that all this sounds like science fiction, we point out 
     that yesterday’s science fiction is today’s fact. The Industrial Revolution 
     has radically altered man’s environment and way of life, and it is only to 
     be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body 
     and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and 
     way of life have been.

HUMAN RACE AT A CROSSROADS

161. But we have gotten ahead of our story. It is one thing to develop in the 
     laboratory a series of psychological or biological techniques for 
     manipulating human behavior and quite another to integrate these techniques 
     into a functioning social system. The latter problem is the more difficult 
     of the two. For example, while the techniques of educational psychology 
     doubtless work quite well in the “lab schools” where they are developed, it 
     is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout our 
     educational system. We all know what many of our schools are like. The 
     teachers are too busy taking knives and guns away from the kids to subject 
     them to the latest techniques for making them into computer nerds. Thus, in 
     spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior, the system 
     to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings. 
     The people whose behavior is fairly well under the control of the system 
     are those of the type that might be called “bourgeois.” But there are 
     growing numbers of people who in one way or another are rebels against the 
     system: welfare leaches, youth gangs, cultists, satanists, nazis, radical 
     environmentalists, militiamen, etc.

162. The system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain 
     problems that threaten its survival, among which the problems of human 
     behavior are the most important. If the system succeeds in acquiring 
     sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably 
     survive. Otherwise it will break down. We think the issue will most likely 
     be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years.

163. Suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades. By that 
     time it will have to have solved, or at least brought under control, the 
     principal problems that confront it, in particular that of “socializing” 
     human beings; that is, making people sufficiently docile so that heir 
     behavior no longer threatens the system. That being accomplished, it does 
     not appear that there would be any further obstacle to the development of 
     technology, and it would presumably advance toward its logical conclusion, 
     which is complete control over everything on Earth, including human beings 
     and all other important organisms. The system may become a unitary, 
     monolithic organization, or it may be more or less fragmented and consist 
     of a number of organizations coexisting in a relationship that includes 
     elements of both cooperation and competition, just as today the government, 
     the corporations and other large organizations both cooperate and compete 
     with one another. Human freedom mostly will have vanished, because 
     individuals and small groups will be impotent vis-a-vis large organizations 
     armed with supertechnology and an arsenal of advanced psychological and 
     biological tools for manipulating human beings, besides instruments of 
     surveillance and physical coercion. Only a small number of people will have 
     any real power, and even these probably will have only very limited 
     freedom, because their behavior too will be regulated; just as today our 
     politicians and corporation executives can retain their positions of power 
     only as long as their behavior remains within certain fairly narrow limits.

164. Don’t imagine that the systems will stop developing further techniques for 
     controlling human beings and nature once the crisis of the next few decades 
     is over and increasing control is no longer necessary for the system’s 
     survival. On the contrary, once the hard times are over the system will 
     increase its control over people and nature more rapidly, because it will 
     no longer be hampered by difficulties of the kind that it is currently 
     experiencing. Survival is not the principal motive for extending control. 
     As we explained in paragraphs 87-90, technicians and scientists carry on 
     their work largely as a surrogate activity; that is, they satisfy their 
     need for power by solving technical problems. They will continue to do this 
     with unabated enthusiasm, and among the most interesting and challenging 
     problems for them to solve will be those of understanding the human body 
     and mind and intervening in their development. For the “good of humanity,” 
     of course.

165. But suppose on the other hand that the stresses of the coming decades prove 
     to be too much for the system. If the system breaks down there may be 
     a period of chaos, a “time of troubles” such as those that history has 
     recorded at various epochs in the past. It is impossible to predict what 
     would emerge from such a time of troubles, but at any rate the human race 
     would be given a new chance. The greatest danger is that industrial society 
     may begin to reconstitute itself within the first few years after the 
     breakdown. Certainly there will be many people (power-hungry types 
     especially) who will be anxious to get the factories running again.

166. Therefore two tasks confront those who hate the servitude to which the 
     industrial system is reducing the human race. First, we must work to 
     heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the 
     likelihood that it will break down or be weakened sufficiently so that 
     a revolution against it becomes possible. Second, it is necessary to 
     develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the 
     industrial society if and when the system becomes sufficiently weakened. 
     And such an ideology will help to assure that, if and when industrial 
     society breaks down, its remnants will be smashed beyond repair, so that 
     the system cannot be reconstituted. The factories should be destroyed, 
     technical books burned, etc.

HUMAN SUFFERING

167. The industrial system will not break down purely as a result of 
     revolutionary action. It will not be vulnerable to revolutionary attack 
     unless its own internal problems of development lead it into very serious 
     difficulties. So if the system breaks down it will do so either 
     spontaneously, or through a process that is in part spontaneous but helped 
     along by revolutionaries. If the breakdown is sudden, many people will die, 
     since the world’s population has become so overblown that it cannot even 
     feed itself any longer without advanced technology. Even if the breakdown 
     is gradual enough so that reduction of the population can occur more 
     through lowering of the birth rate than through elevation of the death 
     rate, the process of de- industrialization probably will be very chaotic 
     and involve much suffering. It is naive to think it likely that technology 
     can be phased out in a smoothly managed, orderly way, especially since the 
     technophiles will fight stubbornly at every step. Is it therefore cruel to 
     work for the breakdown of the system? Maybe, but maybe not. In the first 
     place, revolutionaries will not be able to break the system down unless it 
     is already in enough trouble so that there would be a good chance of its 
     eventually breaking down by itself anyway; and the bigger the system grows, 
     the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will be; so it may be 
     that revolutionaries, by hastening the onset of the breakdown, will be 
     reducing the extent of the disaster.

168. In the second place, one has to balance struggle and death against the loss 
     of freedom and dignity. To many of us, freedom and dignity are more 
     important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain. Besides, we all 
     have to die some time, and it may be better to die fighting for survival, 
     or for a cause, than to live a long but empty and purposeless life.

169. In the third place, it is not at all certain that survival of the system 
     will lead to less suffering than breakdown of the system would. The system 
     has already caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffering all over 
     the world. Ancient cultures, that for hundreds of years gave people 
     a satisfactory relationship with each other and with their environment, 
     have been shattered by contact with industrial society, and the result has 
     been a whole catalogue of economic, environmental, social and psychological 
     problems. One of the effects of the intrusion of industrial society has 
     been that over much of the world traditional controls on population have 
     been thrown out of balance. Hence the population explosion, with all that 
     that implies. Then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread 
     throughout the supposedly fortunate countries of the West (see paragraphs 
     44, 45). No one knows what will happen as a result of ozone depletion, the 
     greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be 
     foreseen. And, as nuclear proliferation has shown, new technology cannot be 
     kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible Third World nations. 
     Would you like to speculate about what Iraq or North Korea will do with 
     genetic engineering?

170. “Oh!” say the technophiles, “Science is going to fix all that! We will 
     conquer famine, eliminate psychological suffering, make everybody healthy 
     and happy!” Yeah, sure. That’s what they said 200 years ago. The Industrial 
     Revolution was supposed to eliminate poverty, make everybody happy, etc. 
     The actual result has been quite different. The technophiles are hopelessly 
     naive (or self-deceiving) in their understanding of social problems. They 
     are unaware of (or choose to ignore) the fact that when large changes, even 
     seemingly beneficial ones, are introduced into a society, they lead to 
     a long sequence of other changes, most of which are impossible to predict 
     (paragraph 103). The result is disruption of the society. So it is very 
     probable that in their attempts to end poverty and disease, engineer 
     docile, happy personalities and so forth, the technophiles will create 
     social systems that are terribly troubled, even more so than the present 
     once. For example, the scientists boast that they will end famine by 
     creating new, genetically engineered food plants. But this will allow the 
     human population to keep expanding indefinitely, and it is well known that 
     crowding leads to increased stress and aggression. This is merely one 
     example of the PREDICTABLE problems that will arise. We emphasize that, as 
     past experience has shown, technical progress will lead to other new 
     problems that CANNOT be predicted in advance (paragraph 103). In fact, ever 
     since the Industrial Revolution, technology has been creating new problems 
     for society far more rapidly than it has been solving old ones. Thus it 
     will take a long and difficult period of trial and error for the 
     technophiles to work the bugs out of their Brave New World (if they every 
     do). In the meantime there will be great suffering. So it is not at all 
     clear that the survival of industrial society would involve less suffering 
     than the breakdown of that society would. Technology has gotten the human 
     race into a fix from which there is not likely to be any easy escape.

THE FUTURE

171. But suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several 
     decades and that the bugs do eventually get worked out of the system, so 
     that it functions smoothly. What kind of system will it be? We will 
     consider several possibilities.

172. First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing 
     intelligent machines that can do all things better than human beings can do 
     them. In that case presumably all work will be done by vast, highly 
     organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary. Either 
     of two cases might occur. The machines might be permitted to make all of 
     their own decisions without human oversight, or else human control over the 
     machines might be retained.

173. If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can’t 
     make any conjectures as to the results, because it is impossible to guess 
     how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate of the 
     human race would be at the mercy of the machines. It might be argued that 
     the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all power to the 
     machines. But we are suggesting neither that the human race would 
     voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would 
     willfully seize power. What we do suggest is that the human race might 
     easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the 
     machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the 
     machines’ decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more 
     and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people 
     will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply 
     because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made 
     ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to 
     keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be 
     incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be 
     in effective control. People won’t be able to just turn the machines off, 
     because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would 
     amount to suicide.

174. On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may 
     be retained. In that case the average man may have control over certain 
     private machines of his own, such as his car or his personal computer, but 
     control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny 
     elite—just as it is today, but with two differences. Due to improved 
     techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because 
     human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, 
     a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply 
     decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use 
     propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the 
     birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to 
     the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft- hearted liberals, they may 
     decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. 
     They will see to it that everyone’s physical needs are satisfied, that all 
     children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that 
     everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may 
     become dissatisfied undergoes “treatment” to cure his “problem.” Of course, 
     life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or 
     psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power 
     process or to make them “sublimate” their drive for power into some 
     harmless hobby. These engineered human beings may be happy in such 
     a society, but they most certainly will not be free. They will have been 
     reduced to the status of domestic animals.

175. But suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in developing 
     artificial intelligence, so that human work remains necessary. Even so, 
     machines will take care of more and more of the simpler tasks so that there 
     will be an increasing surplus of human workers at the lower levels of 
     ability. (We see this happening already. There are many people who find it 
     difficult or impossible to get work, because for intellectual or 
     psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary 
     to make themselves useful in the present system.) On those who are 
     employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: They will need more and 
     more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more 
     reliable, conforming and docile, because they will be more and more like 
     cells of a giant organism. Their tasks will be increasingly specialized, so 
     that their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world, 
     being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality. The system will have to 
     use any means that it can, whether psychological or biological, to engineer 
     people to be docile, to have the abilities that the system requires and to 
     “sublimate” their drive for power into some specialized task. But the 
     statement that the people of such a society will have to be docile may 
     require qualification. The society may find competitiveness useful, 
     provided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels 
     that serve the needs of the system. We can imagine a future society in 
     which there is endless competition for positions of prestige and power. But 
     no more than a very few people will ever reach the top, where the only real 
     power is (see end of paragraph 163). Very repellent is a society in which 
     a person can satisfy his need for power only by pushing large numbers of 
     other people out of the way and depriving them of THEIR opportunity for 
     power.

176. One can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the 
     possibilities that we have just discussed. For instance, it may be that 
     machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical 
     importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given 
     relatively unimportant work. It has been suggested, for example, that 
     a great development of the service industries might provide work for human 
     beings. Thus people would spent their time shining each other’s shoes, 
     driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, 
     waiting on each other’s tables, etc. This seems to us a thoroughly 
     contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many 
     people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work. They would 
     seek other, dangerous outlets (drugs, crime, “cults,” hate groups) unless 
     they were biologically or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such 
     a way of life.

177. Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the 
     possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us 
     most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more 
     palatable than the ones we’ve just described. It is overwhelmingly probable 
     that if the industrial- technological system survives the next 40 to 100 
     years, it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics: 
     Individuals (at least those of the “bourgeois” type, who are integrated 
     into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all the power) will 
     be more dependent than ever on large organizations; they will be more 
     “socialized” than ever and their physical and mental qualities to 
     a significant extent (possibly to a very great extent) will be those that 
     are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance (or of 
     God’s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be 
     reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the 
     supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer be truly 
     wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that 
     neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we 
     know them today, because once you start modifying organisms through genetic 
     engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the 
     modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have 
     been utterly transformed.

178. Whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating 
     for human beings a new physical and social environment radically different 
     from the spectrum of environments to which natural selection has adapted 
     the human race physically and psychologically. If man is not adjusted to 
     this new environment by being artificially re-engineered, then he will be 
     adapted to it through a long and painful process of natural selection. The 
     former is far more likely than the latter.

179. It would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the 
     consequences.

STRATEGY

180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the 
     unknown. Many people understand something of what technological progress is 
     doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is 
     inevitable. But we (FC) don’t think it is inevitable. We think it can be 
     stopped, and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping 
     it.

181. As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to 
     promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop 
     and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial 
     system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, 
     a revolution against technology may be possible. The pattern would be 
     similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. French society and 
     Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, 
     showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were 
     being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from 
     the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively working to 
     undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient 
     additional stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in 
     Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose is something along 
     the same lines.

182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. 
     But most revolutions have two goals. One is to destroy an old form of 
     society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by 
     the revolutionaries. The French and Russian revolutionaries failed 
     (fortunately!) to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed, but 
     they were quite successful in destroying the old society. We have no 
     illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. 
     Our goal is only to destroy the existing form of society.

183. But an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have 
     a positive ideal as well as a negative one; it must be FOR something as 
     well as AGAINST something. The positive ideal that we propose is Nature. 
     That is, WILD nature: those aspects of the functioning of the Earth and its 
     living things that are independent of human management and free of human 
     interference and control. And with wild nature we include human nature, by 
     which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that 
     are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of 
     chance, or free will, or God (depending on your religious or philosophical 
     opinions).

184. Nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. 
     Nature (that which is outside the power of the system) is the opposite of 
     technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the system). 
     Most people will agree that nature is beautiful; certainly it has 
     tremendous popular appeal. The radical environmentalists ALREADY hold an 
     ideology that exalts nature and opposes technology. [30] It is not 
     necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any 
     new kind of social order. Nature takes care of itself: It was a spontaneous 
     creation that existed long before any human society, and for countless 
     centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature 
     without doing it an excessive amount of damage. Only with the Industrial 
     Revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really 
     devastating. To relieve the pressure on nature it is not necessary to 
     create a special kind of social system, it is only necessary to get rid of 
     industrial society. Granted, this will not solve all problems. Industrial 
     society has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will take 
     a very long time for the scars to heal. Besides, even pre-industrial 
     societies can do significant damage to nature. Nevertheless, getting rid of 
     industrial society will accomplish a great deal. It will relieve the worst 
     of the pressure on nature so that the scars can begin to heal. It will 
     remove the capacity of organized society to keep increasing its control 
     over nature (including human nature). Whatever kind of society may exist 
     after the demise of the industrial system, it is certain that most people 
     will live close to nature, because in the absence of advanced technology 
     there is no other way that people CAN live. To feed themselves they must be 
     peasants or herdsmen or fishermen or hunters, etc. And, generally speaking, 
     local autonomy should tend to increase, because lack of advanced technology 
     and rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments or other 
     large organizations to control local communities.

185. As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society—well, 
     you can’t eat your cake and have it too. To gain one thing you have to 
     sacrifice another.

186. Most people hate psychological conflict. For this reason they avoid doing 
     any serious thinking about difficult social issues, and they like to have 
     such issues presented to them in simple, black-and-white terms: THIS is all 
     good and THAT is all bad. The revolutionary ideology should therefore be 
     developed on two levels.

187. On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to 
     people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be 
     to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on 
     a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and 
     ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid 
     of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, 
     as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. 
     These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts 
     should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be 
     avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but 
     in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the 
     truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual 
     respectability of the ideology.

188. On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form 
     that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology 
     vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology 
     should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or 
     irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. 
     Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term 
     gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty 
     of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the 
     passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as 
     soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, 
     propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is 
     nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival 
     ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view 
     goes under.

189. Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have 
     a majority of people on their side. History is made by active, determined 
     minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent 
     idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push 
     toward revolution [31], the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the 
     shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply 
     committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware 
     of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; 
     though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent 
     that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed 
     people.

190. Any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should 
     be careful about what kind of conflict one encourages. The line of conflict 
     should be drawn between the mass of the people and the power-holding elite 
     of industrial society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business 
     executives, government officials, etc.). It should NOT be drawn between the 
     revolutionaries and the mass of the people. For example, it would be bad 
     strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn Americans for their habits of 
     consumption. Instead, the average American should be portrayed as a victim 
     of the advertising and marketing industry, which has suckered him into 
     buying a lot of junk that he doesn’t need and that is very poor 
     compensation for his lost freedom. Either approach is consistent with the 
     facts. It is merely a matter of attitude whether you blame the advertising 
     industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for allowing 
     itself to be manipulated. As a matter of strategy one should generally 
     avoid blaming the public.

191. One should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than 
     that between the power- holding elite (which wields technology) and the 
     general public (over which technology exerts its power). For one thing, 
     other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts 
     (between power-elite and ordinary people, between technology and nature); 
     for another thing, other conflicts may actually tend to encourage 
     technologization, because each side in such a conflict wants to use 
     technological power to gain advantages over its adversary. This is clearly 
     seen in rivalries between nations. It also appears in ethnic conflicts 
     within nations. For example, in America many black leaders are anxious to 
     gain power for African Americans by placing back individuals in the 
     technological power-elite. They want there to be many black government 
     officials, scientists, corporation executives and so forth. In this way 
     they are helping to absorb the African American subculture into the 
     technological system. Generally speaking, one should encourage only those 
     social conflicts that can be fitted into the framework of the conflicts of 
     power-elite vs. ordinary people, technology vs nature.

192. But the way to discourage ethnic conflict is NOT through militant advocacy 
     of minority rights (see paragraphs 21, 29). Instead, the revolutionaries 
     should emphasize that although minorities do suffer more or less 
     disadvantage, this disadvantage is of peripheral significance. Our real 
     enemy is the industrial- technological system, and in the struggle against 
     the system, ethnic distinctions are of no importance.

193. The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an 
     armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical 
     violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on 
     technology and economics, not politics. [32]

194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, 
     whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed 
     to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of 
     most people. Suppose for example that some “green” party should win control 
     of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying 
     or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous 
     measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average 
     man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive 
     unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill 
     effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still 
     people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become 
     addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the “green” party would be voted out 
     of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For 
     this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power 
     until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will 
     be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and 
     not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against 
     technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution 
     from below and not from above.

195. The revolution must be international and worldwide. It cannot be carried 
     out on a nation-by-nation basis. Whenever it is suggested that the United 
     States, for example, should cut back on technological progress or economic 
     growth, people get hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in 
     technology the Japanese will get ahead of us. Holy robots! The world will 
     fly off its orbit if the Japanese ever sell more cars than we do! 
     (Nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) More reasonably, it is 
     argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind 
     in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like China, Vietnam and 
     North Korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to 
     dominate the world. That is why the industrial system should be attacked in 
     all nations simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. True, 
     there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at 
     approximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable 
     that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the 
     domination of the system by dictators. That is a risk that has to be taken. 
     And it is worth taking, since the difference between a “democratic” 
     industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with 
     the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one. [33] 
     It might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators 
     would be preferable, because dictator-controlled systems usually have 
     proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break down. 
     Look at Cuba.

196. Revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the 
     world economy into a unified whole. Free trade agreements like NAFTA and 
     GATT are probably harmful to the environment in the short run, but in the 
     long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic 
     interdependence between nations. It will be easier to destroy the 
     industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so unified 
     that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead to its breakdown in 
     all industrialized nations.

197. Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much 
     control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of 
     the human race. At best these people are expressing themselves unclearly, 
     because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and 
     power for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for 
     powerlessness and passivity, because people NEED power. Modern man as 
     a collective entity—that is, the industrial system—has immense power over 
     nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL 
     GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. 
     Generally speaking, the vast power of “modern man” over nature is exercised 
     not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. To the 
     extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of 
     technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only 
     under the supervision and control of the system. (You need a license for 
     everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) The individual 
     has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to 
     provide him. His PERSONAL power over nature is slight.

198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over 
     nature; or maybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When 
     primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how 
     to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect 
     himself from heat, cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man 
     did relatively little damage to nature because the COLLECTIVE power of 
     primitive society was negligible compared to the COLLECTIVE power of 
     industrial society.

199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that 
     the power of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will 
     greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS.

200. Until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked, the destruction of 
     that system must be the revolutionaries’ ONLY goal. Other goals would 
     distract attention and energy from the main goal. More importantly, if the 
     revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the 
     destruction of technology, they will be tempted to use technology as a tool 
     for reaching that other goal. If they give in to that temptation, they will 
     fall right back into the technological trap, because modern technology is 
     a unified, tightly organized system, so that, in order to retain SOME 
     technology, one finds oneself obliged to retain MOST technology, hence one 
     ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology.

201. Suppose for example that the revolutionaries took “social justice” as 
     a goal. Human nature being what it is, social justice would not come about 
     spontaneously; it would have to be enforced. In order to enforce it the 
     revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control. For 
     that they would need rapid long-distance transportation and communication, 
     and therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and 
     communication systems. To feed and clothe poor people they would have to 
     use agricultural and manufacturing technology. And so forth. So that the 
     attempt to insure social justice would force them to retain most parts of 
     the technological system. Not that we have anything against social justice, 
     but it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the 
     technological system.

202. It would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system 
     without using SOME modern technology. If nothing else they must use the 
     communications media to spread their message. But they should use modern 
     technology for only ONE purpose: to attack the technological system.

203. Imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. Suppose 
     he starts saying to himself, “Wine isn’t bad for you if used in moderation. 
     Why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you! It won’t do me 
     any harm if I take just one little drink.... “ Well you know what is going 
     to happen. Never forget that the human race with technology is just like an 
     alcoholic with a barrel of wine.

204. Revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. There is strong 
     scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent 
     inherited. No one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of 
     a person’s genetic constitution, but it appears that personality traits are 
     partly inherited and that certain personality traits tend, within the 
     context of our society, to make a person more likely to hold this or that 
     social attitude. Objections to these findings have been raised, but the 
     objections are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated. In any event, 
     no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes 
     similar to those of their parents. From our point of view it doesn’t matter 
     all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically or through 
     childhood training. In either case they ARE passed on.

205. The trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against 
     the industrial system are also concerned about the population problems, 
     hence they are apt to have few or no children. In this way they may be 
     handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept 
     the industrial system. To insure the strength of the next generation of 
     revolutionaries the present generation should reproduce itself abundantly. 
     In doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly. 
     And the important problem is to get rid of the industrial system, because 
     once the industrial system is gone the world’s population necessarily will 
     decrease (see paragraph 167); whereas, if the industrial system survives, 
     it will continue developing new techniques of food production that may 
     enable the world’s population to keep increasing almost indefinitely.

206. With regard to revolutionary strategy, the only points on which we 
     absolutely insist are that the single overriding goal must be the 
     elimination of modern technology, and that no other goal can be allowed to 
     compete with this one. For the rest, revolutionaries should take an 
     empirical approach. If experience indicates that some of the 
     recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good 
     results, then those recommendations should be discarded.

TWO KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY

207. An argument likely to be raised against our proposed revolution is that it 
     is bound to fail, because (it is claimed) throughout history technology has 
     always progressed, never regressed, hence technological regression is 
     impossible. But this claim is false.

208. We distinguish between two kinds of technology, which we will call 
     small-scale technology and organization-dependent technology. Small-scale 
     technology is technology that can be used by small-scale communities 
     without outside assistance. Organization-dependent technology is technology 
     that depends on large-scale social organization. We are aware of no 
     significant cases of regression in small-scale technology. But 
     organization-dependent technology DOES regress when the social organization 
     on which it depends breaks down. Example: When the Roman Empire fell apart 
     the Romans’ small-scale technology survived because any clever village 
     craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith could 
     make steel by Roman methods, and so forth. But the Romans’ 
     organization-dependent technology DID regress. Their aqueducts fell into 
     disrepair and were never rebuilt. Their techniques of road construction 
     were lost. The Roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten, so that not 
     until rather recent times did the sanitation of European cities equal that 
     of Ancient Rome.

209. The reason why technology has seemed always to progress is that, until 
     perhaps a century or two before the Industrial Revolution, most technology 
     was small-scale technology. But most of the technology developed since the 
     Industrial Revolution is organization-dependent technology. Take the 
     refrigerator for example. Without factory-made parts or the facilities of 
     a post-industrial machine shop it would be virtually impossible for 
     a handful of local craftsmen to build a refrigerator. If by some miracle 
     they did succeed in building one it would be useless to them without 
     a reliable source of electric power. So they would have to dam a stream and 
     build a generator. Generators require large amounts of copper wire. Imagine 
     trying to make that wire without modern machinery. And where would they get 
     a gas suitable for refrigeration? It would be much easier to build an 
     icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking, as was done before the 
     invention of the refrigerator.

210. So it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken 
     down, refrigeration technology would quickly be lost. The same is true of 
     other organization-dependent technology. And once this technology had been 
     lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild it, just as 
     it took centuries to build it the first time around. Surviving technical 
     books would be few and scattered. An industrial society, if built from 
     scratch without outside help, can only be built in a series of stages: You 
     need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools ... . A long process 
     of economic development and progress in social organization is required. 
     And, even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology, there is no 
     reason to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial 
     society. The enthusiasm for “progress” is a phenomenon peculiar to the 
     modern form of society, and it seems not to have existed prior to the 17th 
     century or thereabouts.

211. In the late Middle Ages there were four main civilizations that were about 
     equally “advanced”: Europe, the Islamic world, India, and the Far East 
     (China, Japan, Korea). Three of those civilizations remained more or less 
     stable, and only Europe became dynamic. No one knows why Europe became 
     dynamic at that time; historians have their theories but these are only 
     speculation. At any rate, it is clear that rapid development toward 
     a technological form of society occurs only under special conditions. So 
     there is no reason to assume that a long-lasting technological regression 
     cannot be brought about.

212. Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological 
     form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t 
     predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems 
     must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.

THE DANGER OF LEFTISM

213. Because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement, 
     leftists or persons of similar psychological type often are unattracted to 
     a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and membership are not 
     initially leftist. The resulting influx of leftish types can easily turn 
     a non-leftist movement into a leftist one, so that leftist goals replace or 
     distort the original goals of the movement.

214. To avoid this, a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must 
     take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with 
     leftists. Leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with 
     human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology. Leftism is 
     collectivist; it seeks to bind together the entire world (both nature and 
     the human race) into a unified whole. But this implies management of nature 
     and of human life by organized society, and it requires advanced 
     technology. You can’t have a united world without rapid transportation and 
     communication, you can’t make all people love one another without 
     sophisticated psychological techniques, you can’t have a “planned society” 
     without the necessary technological base. Above all, leftism is driven by 
     the need for power, and the leftist seeks power on a collective basis, 
     through identification with a mass movement or an organization. Leftism is 
     unlikely ever to give up technology, because technology is too valuable 
     a source of collective power.

215. The anarchist [34] too seeks power, but he seeks it on an individual or 
     small-group basis; he wants individuals and small groups to be able to 
     control the circumstances of their own lives. He opposes technology because 
     it makes small groups dependent on large organizations.

216. Some leftists may seem to oppose technology, but they will oppose it only 
     so long as they are outsiders and the technological system is controlled by 
     non-leftists. If leftism ever becomes dominant in society, so that the 
     technological system becomes a tool in the hands of leftists, they will 
     enthusiastically use it and promote its growth. In doing this they will be 
     repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in the past. 
     When the Bolsheviks in Russia were outsiders, they vigorously opposed 
     censorship and the secret police, they advocated self-determination for 
     ethnic minorities, and so forth; but as soon as they came into power 
     themselves, they imposed a tighter censorship and created a more ruthless 
     secret police than any that had existed under the tsars, and they oppressed 
     ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done. In the United 
     States, a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our 
     universities, leftist professors were vigorous proponents of academic 
     freedom, but today, in those of our universities where leftists have become 
     dominant, they have shown themselves ready to take away from everyone 
     else’s academic freedom. (This is “political correctness.”) The same will 
     happen with leftists and technology: They will use it to oppress everyone 
     else if they ever get it under their own control.

217. In earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type, repeatedly, 
     have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries, as well as with 
     leftists of a more libertarian inclination, and later have double- crossed 
     them to seize power for themselves. Robespierre did this in the French 
     Revolution, the Bolsheviks did it in the Russian Revolution, the communists 
     did it in Spain in 1938 and Castro and his followers did it in Cuba. Given 
     the past history of leftism, it would be utterly foolish for non-leftist 
     revolutionaries today to collaborate with leftists.

218. Various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion. 
     Leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because leftist doctrine does 
     not postulate the existence of any supernatural being. But, for the 
     leftist, leftism plays a psychological role much like that which religion 
     plays for some people. The leftist NEEDS to believe in leftism; it plays 
     a vital role in his psychological economy. His beliefs are not easily 
     modified by logic or facts. He has a deep conviction that leftism is 
     morally Right with a capital R, and that he has not only a right but a duty 
     to impose leftist morality on everyone. (However, many of the people we are 
     referring to as “leftists” do not think of themselves as leftists and would 
     not describe their system of beliefs as leftism. We use the term “leftism” 
     because we don’t know of any better words to designate the spectrum of 
     related creeds that includes the feminist, gay rights, political 
     correctness, etc., movements, and because these movements have a strong 
     affinity with the old left. See paragraphs 227-230.)

219. Leftism is a totalitarian force. Wherever leftism is in a position of power 
     it tends to invade every private corner and force every thought into 
     a leftist mold. In part this is because of the quasi-religious character of 
     leftism; everything contrary to leftist beliefs represents Sin. More 
     importantly, leftism is a totalitarian force because of the leftists’ drive 
     for power. The leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power through 
     identification with a social movement and he tries to go through the power 
     process by helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see 
     paragraph 83). But no matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its 
     goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate 
     activity (see paragraph 41). That is, the leftist’s real motive is not to 
     attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is motivated by the 
     sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal. 
     [35] Consequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has 
     already attained; his need for the power process leads him always to pursue 
     some new goal. The leftist wants equal opportunities for minorities. When 
     that is attained he insists on statistical equality of achievement by 
     minorities. And as long as anyone harbors in some corner of his mind 
     a negative attitude toward some minority, the leftist has to re-educated 
     him. And ethnic minorities are not enough; no one can be allowed to have 
     a negative attitude toward homosexuals, disabled people, fat people, old 
     people, ugly people, and on and on and on. It’s not enough that the public 
     should be informed about the hazards of smoking; a warning has to be 
     stamped on every package of cigarettes. Then cigarette advertising has to 
     be restricted if not banned. The activists will never be satisfied until 
     tobacco is outlawed, and after that it will be alcohol, then junk food, 
     etc. Activists have fought gross child abuse, which is reasonable. But now 
     they want to stop all spanking. When they have done that they will want to 
     ban something else they consider unwholesome, then another thing and then 
     another. They will never be satisfied until they have complete control over 
     all child rearing practices. And then they will move on to another cause.

220. Suppose you asked leftists to make a list of ALL the things that were wrong 
     with society, and then suppose you instituted EVERY social change that they 
     demanded. It is safe to say that within a couple of years the majority of 
     leftists would find something new to complain about, some new social “evil” 
     to correct because, once again, the leftist is motivated less by distress 
     at society’s ills than by the need to satisfy his drive for power by 
     imposing his solutions on society.

221. Because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior by their 
     high level of socialization, many leftists of the over-socialized type 
     cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do. For them the drive 
     for power has only one morally acceptable outlet, and that is in the 
     struggle to impose their morality on everyone.

222. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are True Believers 
     in the sense of Eric Hoffer’s book, “The True Believer.” But not all True 
     Believers are of the same psychological type as leftists. Presumably 
     a true-believing nazi, for instance, is very different psychologically from 
     a true-believing leftist. Because of their capacity for single-minded 
     devotion to a cause, True Believers are a useful, perhaps a necessary, 
     ingredient of any revolutionary movement. This presents a problem with 
     which we must admit we don’t know how to deal. We aren’t sure how to 
     harness the energies of the True Believer to a revolution against 
     technology. At present all we can say is that no True Believer will make 
     a safe recruit to the revolution unless his commitment is exclusively to 
     the destruction of technology. If he is committed also to another ideal, he 
     may want to use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal (see 
     paragraphs 220, 221).

223. Some readers may say, “This stuff about leftism is a lot of crap. I know 
     John and Jane who are leftish types and they don’t have all these 
     totalitarian tendencies.” It’s quite true that many leftists, possibly even 
     a numerical majority, are decent people who sincerely believe in tolerating 
     others’ values (up to a point) and wouldn’t want to use high-handed methods 
     to reach their social goals. Our remarks about leftism are not meant to 
     apply to every individual leftist but to describe the general character of 
     leftism as a movement. And the general character of a movement is not 
     necessarily determined by the numerical proportions of the various kinds of 
     people involved in the movement.

224. The people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements tend to be 
     leftists of the most power- hungry type, because power-hungry people are 
     those who strive hardest to get into positions of power. Once the 
     power-hungry types have captured control of the movement, there are many 
     leftists of a gentler breed who inwardly disapprove of many of the actions 
     of the leaders, but cannot bring themselves to oppose them. They NEED their 
     faith in the movement, and because they cannot give up this faith they go 
     along with the leaders. True, SOME leftists do have the guts to oppose the 
     totalitarian tendencies that emerge, but they generally lose, because the 
     power-hungry types are better organized, are more ruthless and 
     Machiavellian and have taken care to build themselves a strong power base.

225. These phenomena appeared clearly in Russia and other countries that were 
     taken over by leftists. Similarly, before the breakdown of communism in the 
     USSR, leftish types in the West would seldom criticize that country. If 
     prodded they would admit that the USSR did many wrong things, but then they 
     would try to find excuses for the communists and begin talking about the 
     faults of the West. They always opposed Western military resistance to 
     communist aggression. Leftish types all over the world vigorously protested 
     the U.S. military action in Vietnam, but when the USSR invaded Afghanistan 
     they did nothing. Not that they approved of the Soviet actions; but because 
     of their leftist faith, they just couldn’t bear to put themselves in 
     opposition to communism. Today, in those of our universities where 
     “political correctness” has become dominant, there are probably many 
     leftish types who privately disapprove of the suppression of academic 
     freedom, but they go along with it anyway.

226. Thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild and fairly 
     tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a whole form having 
     a totalitarian tendency.

227. Our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. It is still far from 
     clear what we mean by the word “leftist.” There doesn’t seem to be much we 
     can do about this. Today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of 
     activist movements. Yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some 
     activist movements (e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both 
     personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly 
     un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with 
     leftists. Varieties of leftists fade out gradually into varieties of 
     non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed to decide whether 
     a given individual is or is not a leftist. To the extent that it is defined 
     at all, our conception of leftism is defined by the discussion of it that 
     we have given in this article, and we can only advise the reader to use his 
     own judgment in deciding who is a leftist.

228. But it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism. These 
     criteria cannot be applied in a cut and dried manner. Some individuals may 
     meet some of the criteria without being leftists, some leftists may not 
     meet any of the criteria. Again, you just have to use your judgment.

229. The leftist is oriented toward large-scale collectivism. He emphasizes the 
     duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take 
     care of the individual. He has a negative attitude toward individualism. He 
     often takes a moralistic tone. He tends to be for gun control, for sex 
     education and other psychologically “enlightened” educational methods, for 
     social planning, for affirmative action, for multiculturalism. He tends to 
     identify with victims. He tends to be against competition and against 
     violence, but he often finds excuses for those leftists who do commit 
     violence. He is fond of using the common catch- phrases of the left, like 
     “racism,” “sexism,” “homophobia,” “capitalism,” “imperialism,” 
     “neocolonialism,” “genocide,” “social change,” “social justice,” “social 
     responsibility.” Maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his 
     tendency to sympathize with the following movements: feminism, gay rights, 
     ethnic rights, disability rights, animal rights, political correctness. 
     Anyone who strongly sympathizes with ALL of these movements is almost 
     certainly a leftist. [36]

230. The more dangerous leftists, that is, those who are most power-hungry, are 
     often characterized by arrogance or by a dogmatic approach to ideology. 
     However, the most dangerous leftists of all may be certain oversocialized 
     types who avoid irritating displays of aggressiveness and refrain from 
     advertising their leftism, but work quietly and unobtrusively to promote 
     collectivist values, “enlightened” psychological techniques for socializing 
     children, dependence of the individual on the system, and so forth. These 
     crypto- leftists (as we may call them) approximate certain bourgeois types 
     as far as practical action is concerned, but differ from them in 
     psychology, ideology and motivation. The ordinary bourgeois tries to bring 
     people under control of the system in order to protect his way of life, or 
     he does so simply because his attitudes are conventional. The 
     crypto-leftist tries to bring people under control of the system because he 
     is a True Believer in a collectivistic ideology. The crypto-leftist is 
     differentiated from the average leftist of the oversocialized type by the 
     fact that his rebellious impulse is weaker and he is more securely 
     socialized. He is differentiated from the ordinary well-socialized 
     bourgeois by the fact that there is some deep lack within him that makes it 
     necessary for him to devote himself to a cause and immerse himself in 
     a collectivity. And maybe his (well-sublimated) drive for power is stronger 
     than that of the average bourgeois.

FINAL NOTE

231. Throughout this article we’ve made imprecise statements and statements that 
     ought to have had all sorts of qualifications and reservations attached to 
     them; and some of our statements may be flatly false. Lack of sufficient 
     information and the need for brevity made it impossible for us to formulate 
     our assertions more precisely or add all the necessary qualifications. And 
     of course in a discussion of this kind one must rely heavily on intuitive 
     judgment, and that can sometimes be wrong. So we don’t claim that this 
     article expresses more than a crude approximation to the truth.

232. All the same, we are reasonably confident that the general outlines of the 
     picture we have painted here are roughly correct. Just one possible weak 
     point needs to be mentioned. We have portrayed leftism in its modern form 
     as a phenomenon peculiar to our time and as a symptom of the disruption of 
     the power process. But we might possibly be wrong about this. 
     Oversocialized types who try to satisfy their drive for power by imposing 
     their morality on everyone have certainly been around for a long time. But 
     we THINK that the decisive role played by feelings of inferiority, low 
     self-esteem, powerlessness, identification with victims by people who are 
     not themselves victims, is a peculiarity of modern leftism. Identification 
     with victims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some extent in 
     19th century leftism and early Christianity but as far as we can make out, 
     symptoms of low self-esteem, etc., were not nearly so evident in these 
     movements, or in any other movements, as they are in modern leftism. But we 
     are not in a position to assert confidently that no such movements have 
     existed prior to modern leftism. This is a significant question to which 
     historians ought to give their attention.

Notes

1. (Paragraph 19) We are asserting that ALL, or even most, bullies and ruthless 
   competitors suffer from feelings of inferiority.

2. (Paragraph 25) During the Victorian period many oversocialized people 
   suffered from serious psychological problems as a result of repressing or 
   trying to repress their sexual feelings. Freud apparently based his theories 
   on people of this type. Today the focus of socialization has shifted from sex 
   to aggression.

3. (Paragraph 27) Not necessarily including specialists in engineering or the 
   “hard” sciences.

4. (Paragraph 28) There are many individuals of the middle and upper classes who 
   resist some of these values, but usually their resistance is more or less 
   covert. Such resistance appears in the mass media only to a very limited 
   extent. The main thrust of propaganda in our society is in favor of the 
   stated values.
   
   The main reason why these values have become, so to speak, the official values
   of our society is that they are useful to the industrial system. Violence is
   discouraged because it disrupts the functioning of the system. Racism is 
   discouraged because ethnic conflicts also disrupt the system, and 
   discrimination wastes the talents of minority-group members who could be 
   useful to the system. Poverty must be “cured” because the underclass causes 
   problems for the system and contact with the underclass lowers the morale of 
   the other classes. Women are encouraged to have careers because their talents 
   are useful to the system and, more importantly, because by having regular 
   jobs women become better integrated into the system and tied directly to it
   rather than to their families. This helps to weaken family solidarity. (The 
   leaders of the system say they want to strengthen the family, but they really
   mean is that they want the family to serve as an effective tool for
   socializing children in accord with the needs of the system. We argue in 
   paragraphs 51, 52 that the system cannot afford to let the family or other 
   small-scale social groups be strong or autonomous.)

5. (Paragraph 42) It may be argued that the majority of people don’t want to 
   make their own decisions but want leaders to do their thinking for them. 
   There is an element of truth in this. People like to make their own decisions 
   in small matters, but making decisions on difficult, fundamental questions 
   requires facing up to psychological conflict, and most people hate 
   psychological conflict. Hence they tend to lean on others in making difficult 
   decisions. But it does not follow that they like to have decisions imposed 
   upon them without having any opportunity to influence those decisions. The 
   majority of people are natural followers, not leaders, but they like to have 
   direct personal access to their leaders, they want to be able to influence 
   the leaders and participate to some extent in making even the difficult 
   decisions. At least to that degree they need autonomy.

6. (Paragraph 44) Some of the symptoms listed are similar to those shown by 
   caged animals.
   
   To explain how these symptoms arise from deprivation with respect to the 
   power process:
   
   Common-sense understanding of human nature tells one that lack of goals whose 
   attainment requires effort leads to boredom and that boredom, long continued,
   often leads eventually to depression. Failure to attain goals leads to 
   frustration and lowering of self-esteem. Frustration leads to anger, anger to 
   aggression, often in the form of spouse or child abuse. It has been shown that 
   long-continued frustration commonly leads to depression and that depression 
   tends to cause guilt, sleep disorders, eating disorders and bad feelings about 
   oneself. Those who are tending toward depression seek pleasure as an antidote; 
   hence insatiable hedonism and excessive sex, with perversions as a means of 
   getting new kicks. Boredom too tends to cause excessive pleasure-seeking since, 
   lacking other goals, people often use pleasure as a goal. See accompanying 
   diagram.
   
   The foregoing is a simplification. Reality is more complex, and of course, 
   deprivation with respect to the power process is not the ONLY cause of the 
   symptoms described.
   
   By the way, when we mention depression we do not necessarily mean depression 
   that is severe enough to be treated by a psychiatrist. Often only mild forms of 
   depression are involved. And when we speak of goals we do not necessarily mean 
   long-term, thought-out goals. For many or most people through much of human 
   history, the goals of a hand-to-mouth existence (merely providing oneself and 
   one’s family with food from day to day) have been quite sufficient.

7. (Paragraph 52) A partial exception may be made for a few passive, 
   inward-looking groups, such as the Amish, which have little effect on the 
   wider society. Apart from these, some genuine small-scale communities do 
   exist in America today. For instance, youth gangs and “cults.” Everyone 
   regards them as dangerous, and so they are, because the members of these 
   groups are loyal primarily to one another rather than to the system, hence 
   the system cannot control them.
   
   Or take the gypsies. The gypsies commonly get away with theft and fraud because 
   their loyalties are such that they can always get other gypsies to give 
   testimony that “proves” their innocence. Obviously the system would be in 
   serious trouble if too many people belonged to such groups.
   
   Some of the early-20th century Chinese thinkers who were concerned with 
   modernizing China recognized the necessity breaking down small-scale social 
   groups such as the family: “(According to Sun Yat-sen) the Chinese people needed 
   a new surge of patriotism, which would lead to a transfer of loyalty from the 
   family to the state.... (According to Li Huang) traditional attachments, 
   particularly to the family had to be abandoned if nationalism were to develop in 
   China.” (Chester C. Tan, “Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth Century,” 
   page 125, page 297.)

8. (Paragraph 56) Yes, we know that 19th century America had its problems, and 
   serious ones, but for the sake of brevity we have to express ourselves in 
   simplified terms.

9. (Paragraph 61) We leave aside the “underclass.” We are speaking of the 
   mainstream.

10. (Paragraph 62) Some social scientists, educators, “mental health” 
    professionals and the like are doing their best to push the social drives 
    into group 1 by trying to see to it that everyone has a satisfactory social 
    life.

11. (Paragraphs 63, 82) Is the drive for endless material acquisition really an 
    artificial creation of the advertising and marketing industry? Certainly 
    there is no innate human drive for material acquisition. There have been 
    many cultures in which people have desired little material wealth beyond 
    what was necessary to satisfy their basic physical needs (Australian 
    aborigines, traditional Mexican peasant culture, some African cultures). On 
    the other hand there have also been many pre-industrial cultures in which 
    material acquisition has played an important role. So we can’t claim that 
    today’s acquisition-oriented culture is exclusively a creation of the 
    advertising and marketing industry. But it is clear that the advertising and 
    marketing industry has had an important part in creating that culture. The 
    big corporations that spend millions on advertising wouldn’t be spending 
    that kind of money without solid proof that they were getting it back in 
    increased sales. One member of FC met a sales manager a couple of years ago 
    who was frank enough to tell him, “Our job is to make people buy things they 
    don’t want and don’t need.” He then described how an untrained novice could 
    present people with the facts about a product, and make no sales at all, 
    while a trained and experienced professional salesman would make lots of 
    sales to the same people. This shows that people are manipulated into buying 
    things they don’t really want.

12. (Paragraph 64) The problem of purposelessness seems to have become less 
    serious during the last 15 years or so, because people now feel less secure 
    physically and economically than they did earlier, and the need for security 
    provides them with a goal. But purposelessness has been replaced by 
    frustration over the difficulty of attaining security. We emphasize the 
    problem of purposelessness because the liberals and leftists would wish to 
    solve our social problems by having society guarantee everyone’s security; 
    but if that could be done it would only bring back the problem of 
    purposelessness. The real issue is not whether society provides well or 
    poorly for people’s security; the trouble is that people are dependent on 
    the system for their security rather than having it in their own hands. 
    This, by the way, is part of the reason why some people get worked up about 
    the right to bear arms; possession of a gun puts that aspect of their 
    security in their own hands.

13. (Paragraph 66) Conservatives’ efforts to decrease the amount of government 
    regulation are of little benefit to the average man. For one thing, only 
    a fraction of the regulations can be eliminated because most regulations are 
    necessary. For another thing, most of the deregulation affects business 
    rather than the average individual, so that its main effect is to take power 
    from the government and give it to private corporations. What this means for 
    the average man is that government interference in his life is replaced by 
    interference from big corporations, which may be permitted, for example, to 
    dump more chemicals that get into his water supply and give him cancer. The 
    conservatives are just taking the average man for a sucker, exploiting his 
    resentment of Big Government to promote the power of Big Business.

14. (Paragraph 73) When someone approves of the purpose for which propaganda is 
    being used in a given case, he generally calls it “education” or applies to 
    it some similar euphemism. But propaganda is propaganda regardless of the 
    purpose for which it is used.

15. (Paragraph 83) We are not expressing approval or disapproval of the Panama 
    invasion. We only use it to illustrate a point.

16. (Paragraph 95) When the American colonies were under British rule there were 
    fewer and less effective legal guarantees of freedom than there were after 
    the American Constitution went into effect, yet there was more personal 
    freedom in pre-industrial America, both before and after the War of 
    Independence, than there was after the Industrial Revolution took hold in 
    this country. We quote from “Violence in America: Historical and Comparative 
    Perspectives,” edited by Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, Chapter 12 
    by Roger Lane, pages 476-478:
    
    “The progressive heightening of standards of propriety, and with it the 
    increasing reliance on official law enforcement (in 19th century America) ... 
    were common to the whole society.... [T]he change in social behavior is so long 
    term and so widespread as to suggest a connection with the most fundamental of 
    contemporary social processes; that of industrial urbanization 
    itself....”Massachusetts in 1835 had a population of some 660,940, 81 percent 
    rural, overwhelmingly preindustrial and native born. It’s citizens were used to 
    considerable personal freedom. Whether teamsters, farmers or artisans, they were 
    all accustomed to setting their own schedules, and the nature of their work made 
    them physically independent of each other.... Individual problems, sins or even 
    crimes, were not generally cause for wider social concern....”But the impact of 
    the twin movements to the city and to the factory, both just gathering force in 
    1835, had a progressive effect on personal behavior throughout the 19th century 
    and into the 20th. The factory demanded regularity of behavior, a life governed 
    by obedience to the rhythms of clock and calendar, the demands of foreman and 
    supervisor. In the city or town, the needs of living in closely packed 
    neighborhoods inhibited many actions previously unobjectionable. Both blue- and 
    white-collar employees in larger establishments were mutually dependent on their 
    fellows; as one man’s work fit into anther’s, so one man’s business was no 
    longer his own.
    
    “The results of the new organization of life and work were apparent by 1900, 
    when some 76 percent of the 2,805,346 inhabitants of Massachusetts were 
    classified as urbanites. Much violent or irregular behavior which had been 
    tolerable in a casual, independent society was no longer acceptable in the more 
    formalized, cooperative atmosphere of the later period.... The move to the 
    cities had, in short, produced a more tractable, more socialized, more 
    ‘civilized’ generation than its predecessors.”

17. (Paragraph 117) Apologists for the system are fond of citing cases in which 
    elections have been decided by one or two votes, but such cases are rare.

18. (Paragraph 119) “Today, in technologically advanced lands, men live very 
    similar lives in spite of geographical, religious, and political 
    differences. The daily lives of a Christian bank clerk in Chicago, 
    a Buddhist bank clerk in Tokyo, and a Communist bank clerk in Moscow are far 
    more alike than the life of any one of them is like that of any single man 
    who lived a thousand years ago. These similarities are the result of 
    a common technology....” L. Sprague de Camp, “The Ancient Engineers,” 
    Ballantine edition, page 17.
    
    The lives of the three bank clerks are not IDENTICAL. Ideology does have SOME 
    effect. But all technological societies, in order to survive, must evolve along 
    APPROXIMATELY the same trajectory.

19. (Paragraph 123) Just think an irresponsible genetic engineer might create 
    a lot of terrorists.

20. (Paragraph 124) For a further example of undesirable consequences of medical 
    progress, suppose a reliable cure for cancer is discovered. Even if the 
    treatment is too expensive to be available to any but the elite, it will 
    greatly reduce their incentive to stop the escape of carcinogens into the 
    environment.

21. (Paragraph 128) Since many people may find paradoxical the notion that 
    a large number of good things can add up to a bad thing, we illustrate with 
    an analogy. Suppose Mr. A is playing chess with Mr. B. Mr. C, a Grand 
    Master, is looking over Mr. A’s shoulder. Mr. A of course wants to win his 
    game, so if Mr. C points out a good move for him to make, he is doing Mr. 
    A a favor. But suppose now that Mr. C tells Mr. A how to make ALL of his 
    moves. In each particular instance he does Mr. A a favor by showing him his 
    best move, but by making ALL of his moves for him he spoils his game, since 
    there is not point in Mr. A’s playing the game at all if someone else makes 
    all his moves.
    
    The situation of modern man is analogous to that of Mr. A. The system makes an 
    individual’s life easier for him in innumerable ways, but in doing so it 
    deprives him of control over his own fate.

22. (Paragraph 137) Here we are considering only the conflict of values within 
    the mainstream. For the sake of simplicity we leave out of the picture 
    “outsider” values like the idea that wild nature is more important than 
    human economic welfare.

23. (Paragraph 137) Self-interest is not necessarily MATERIAL self-interest. It 
    can consist in fulfillment of some psychological need, for example, by 
    promoting one’s own ideology or religion.

24. (Paragraph 139) A qualification: It is in the interest of the system to 
    permit a certain prescribed degree of freedom in some areas. For example, 
    economic freedom (with suitable limitations and restraints) has proved 
    effective in promoting economic growth. But only planned, circumscribed, 
    limited freedom is in the interest of the system. The individual must always 
    be kept on a leash, even if the leash is sometimes long (see paragraphs 94, 
    97).

25. (Paragraph 143) We don’t mean to suggest that the efficiency or the 
    potential for survival of a society has always been inversely proportional 
    to the amount of pressure or discomfort to which the society subjects 
    people. That certainly is not the case. There is good reason to believe that 
    many primitive societies subjected people to less pressure than European 
    society did, but European society proved far more efficient than any 
    primitive society and always won out in conflicts with such societies 
    because of the advantages conferred by technology.

26. (Paragraph 147) If you think that more effective law enforcement is 
    unequivocally good because it suppresses crime, then remember that crime as 
    defined by the system is not necessarily what YOU would call crime. Today, 
    smoking marijuana is a “crime,” and, in some places in the U.S., so is 
    possession of an unregistered handgun. Tomorrow, possession of ANY firearm, 
    registered or not, may be made a crime, and the same thing may happen with 
    disapproved methods of child-rearing, such as spanking. In some countries, 
    expression of dissident political opinions is a crime, and there is no 
    certainty that this will never happen in the U.S., since no constitution or 
    political system lasts forever.
    
    If a society needs a large, powerful law enforcement establishment, then there 
    is something gravely wrong with that society; it must be subjecting people to 
    severe pressures if so many refuse to follow the rules, or follow them only 
    because forced. Many societies in the past have gotten by with little or no 
    formal law- enforcement.

27. (Paragraph 151) To be sure, past societies have had means of influencing 
    human behavior, but these have been primitive and of low effectiveness 
    compared with the technological means that are now being developed.

28. (Paragraph 152) However, some psychologists have publicly expressed opinions 
    indicating their contempt for human freedom. And the mathematician Claude 
    Shannon was quoted in Omni (August 1987) as saying, “I visualize a time when 
    we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I’m rooting for the 
    machines.”

29. (Paragraph 154) This is no science fiction! After writing paragraph 154 we 
    came across an article in Scientific American according to which scientists 
    are actively developing techniques for identifying possible future criminals 
    and for treating them by a combination of biological and psychological 
    means. Some scientists advocate compulsory application of the treatment, 
    which may be available in the near future. (See “Seeking the Criminal 
    Element,” by W. Wayt Gibbs, Scientific American, March 1995.) Maybe you 
    think this is OK because the treatment would be applied to those who might 
    become violent criminals. But of course it won’t stop there. Next, 
    a treatment will be applied to those who might become drunk drivers (they 
    endanger human life too), then perhaps to peel who spank their children, 
    then to environmentalists who sabotage logging equipment, eventually to 
    anyone whose behavior is inconvenient for the system.

30. (Paragraph 184) A further advantage of nature as a counter-ideal to 
    technology is that, in many people, nature inspires the kind of reverence 
    that is associated with religion, so that nature could perhaps be idealized 
    on a religious basis. It is true that in many societies religion has served 
    as a support and justification for the established order, but it is also 
    true that religion has often provided a basis for rebellion. Thus it may be 
    useful to introduce a religious element into the rebellion against 
    technology, the more so because Western society today has no strong 
    religious foundation. Religion, nowadays either is used as cheap and 
    transparent support for narrow, short-sighted selfishness (some 
    conservatives use it this way), or even is cynically exploited to make easy 
    money (by many evangelists), or has degenerated into crude irrationalism 
    (fundamentalist protestant sects, “cults”), or is simply stagnant 
    (Catholicism, main-line Protestantism). The nearest thing to a strong, 
    widespread, dynamic religion that the West has seen in recent times has been 
    the quasi-religion of leftism, but leftism today is fragmented and has no 
    clear, unified, inspiring goal.
    
    Thus there is a religious vacuum in our society that could perhaps be filled by 
    a religion focused on nature in opposition to technology. But it would be 
    a mistake to try to concoct artificially a religion to fill this role. Such an 
    invented religion would probably be a failure. Take the “Gaia” religion for 
    example. Do its adherents REALLY believe in it or are they just play-acting? If 
    they are just play-acting their religion will be a flop in the end.
    
    It is probably best not to try to introduce religion into the conflict of nature 
    vs. technology unless you REALLY believe in that religion yourself and find that 
    it arouses a deep, strong, genuine response in many other people.

31. (Paragraph 189) Assuming that such a final push occurs. Conceivably the 
    industrial system might be eliminated in a somewhat gradual or piecemeal 
    fashion (see paragraphs 4, 167 and Note 4).

32. (Paragraph 193) It is even conceivable (remotely) that the revolution might 
    consist only of a massive change of attitudes toward technology resulting in 
    a relatively gradual and painless disintegration of the industrial system. 
    But if this happens we’ll be very lucky. It’s far more probably that the 
    transition to a nontechnological society will be very difficult and full of 
    conflicts and disasters.

33. (Paragraph 195) The economic and technological structure of a society are 
    far more important than its political structure in determining the way the 
    average man lives (see paragraphs 95, 119 and Notes 16, 18).

34. (Paragraph 215) This statement refers to our particular brand of anarchism. 
    A wide variety of social attitudes have been called “anarchist,” and it may 
    be that many who consider themselves anarchists would not accept our 
    statement of paragraph 215. It should be noted, by the way, that there is 
    a nonviolent anarchist movement whose members probably would not accept FC 
    as anarchist and certainly would not approve of FC’s violent methods.

35. (Paragraph 219) Many leftists are motivated also by hostility, but the 
    hostility probably results in part from a frustrated need for power.

36. (Paragraph 229) It is important to understand that we mean someone who 
    sympathizes with these MOVEMENTS as they exist today in our society. One who 
    believes that women, homosexuals, etc., should have equal rights is not 
    necessary a leftist. The feminist, gay rights, etc., movements that exist in 
    our society have the particular ideological tone that characterizes leftism, 
    and if one believes, for example, that women should have equal rights it 
    does not necessarily follow that one must sympathize with the feminist 
    movement as it exists today.

16. (Paragraph 95) When the American colonies were under British rule there were 
    fewer and less effective legal guarantees of freedom than there were after 
    the American Constitution went into effect, yet there was more personal 
    freedom in pre-industrial America, both before and after the War of 
    Independence, than there was after the Industrial Revolution took hold in 
    this country. In “Violence in America: Historical and Comparative 
    Perspectives,” edited by Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, Chapter 12 
    by Roger Lane, it is explained how in pre-industrial America the average 
    person had greater independence and autonomy than he does today, and how the 
    process of industrialization necessarily led to the restriction of personal 
    freedom.
