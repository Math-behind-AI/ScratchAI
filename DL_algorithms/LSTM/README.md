# Sentiment Ananlysis of Commodity News using Bidirectional LSTM

## :dart: GOAL

#### :pencil2: Develop a model to classify Commodity Sentiments into predefined categories. 
Note: Text classification is an example of supervised machine learning since we train the model with labelled data.

## :brain: Sentiment Analysis

* Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.
* By using sentiment analysis, you gauge how customers feel about different areas of your business without having to read thousands of customer comments at once. If you have thousands of feedback per month, it is impossible for one person to read all of these responses

#### :pencil2: CNNs play an important part in a variety of activities/functions such as image processing difficulties, computer vision tasks such as localization and segmentation, video analysis, recognising obstacles in self-driving cars, and speech recognition in natural language processing.

#### :pencil2: Here we have built a ConvNet to identify Sign language digits from scratch along with in-depth implementation of each layer in neural network
