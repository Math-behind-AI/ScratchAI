# Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

### Libraries used:
`Numpy` <br>
`Matplotlib` <br>
`Pandas` <br>
`Tensorflow` <br>

#### :pencil2: A CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, is a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used for image/object detection and classification. Deep Learning detects things in images by employing a CNN.

#### :pencil2: CNNs play an important part in a variety of activities/functions such as image processing difficulties, computer vision tasks such as localization and segmentation, video analysis, recognising obstacles in self-driving cars, and speech recognition in natural language processing.

#### :pencil2: Here we have built a ConvNet to identify Sign language digits from scratch along with in-depth implementation of each layer in neural network
