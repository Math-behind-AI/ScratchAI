# CatBoost Regressor

Packages used:<br>
`Numpy` : 1.19.5<br>
`Pandas` : 1.2.4<br>

CatBoost builds upon the theory of decision trees and gradient boosting. The main idea of boosting is to sequentially combine many weak models (a model performing slightly better than random chance) and thus through greedy search create a strong competitive predictive model.
