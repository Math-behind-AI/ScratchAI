## Principal Component Analysis

### Packages used:

`Numpy'
`Pandas`
'Sklearn'
'Matplotlib'

### Brief explanation:

An algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of a data set to a lower-dimensional linear subspace by linear projection
in such a way that the reconstruction error made by the linear projection is as
low as possible.

The implementation of Principal Component Analysis on Face Recognition is also present in the repository.
